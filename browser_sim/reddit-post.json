            "selftext": "It\u2019ll be a long post, but if you\u2019re considering starting (or have already started) an AI agency or something similar, this post could, at best, save you months (maybe even years) and at worst, give you insights you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nAnd no, this isn\u2019t one of those \u201chow I scaled my agency to \\[insert big number\\] in X months\u201d or \u201cthings I wish I knew before I started\u201d posts that end up being covert promotions. I have nothing to sell.\n\nJust a guy who\u2019s been in the AI agency space since the very start, around 2022, deciding on a random Saturday to waste an hour writing this instead of doing the real work he was supposed to do (don\u2019t judge me) because the amount of misleading beginners with misinformation I see on here is disgusting. \n\nWhen I started, I built everything: chatbots that collected leads, full workflow automations that handled follow-ups, reminders, pipeline logic, automatic assignments, etc., you name it. These were the early days of the AIAA model when Liam Ottley only had around 10-50k subs lol. \n\nAnd in that process, I learned my biggest lesson: the most important skill you need to learn to make money online isn't how good you are at your work. It's how good you are at FINDING CLIENTS. \n\nNot building. Not automating. Not learning tools. But finding clients.\n\nPeople underestimate how big that skill is because it sounds vague. But if you break it down, it\u2019s basically your ability to connect a problem to someone who has the budget and trust to pay you to solve it. \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nThat\u2019s the real business skill. You can be the most technically skilled person in the world, but if you can\u2019t get someone to pay you, none of it matters. \n\n**Upwork, Fiverr, and the supply-demand problem**\n\nI tried Upwork and Fiverr like everyone else. Brutal.\n\nThe competition there is so cut-throat and the supply of freelancers to the actual demand is so ridiculously skewed that even the people offering dirt-cheap rates can still afford to pick only from people with existing credibility. That means, if you're just starting out, you'd better get ready to slave your way to the top. \n\nBut I want to add a quick disclaimer: while this has been my experience, I also know people who\u2019ve had tremendous success on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nBut if you do decide to grind your way up, build a reputation, get 50 reviews, get top-rated badges, great. But all that credibility stays locked inside that one platform. The moment you step out, you start from zero again. That\u2019s when I realized I didn\u2019t want to be platform-dependent. I\u2019d rather just start from scratch in public, where I actually own my presence.\n\n**Cold outreach reality**\n\nSo I went all in on cold outreach. Emails, DMs, LinkedIn, Reddit.\n\nI learned fast that interest isn\u2019t the same as budget.\n\nSmall businesses often liked my automations but couldn\u2019t justify the cost. If they\u2019re barely making $2k a month, they\u2019ll do things manually until they stabilize. \n\nBig companies could afford automations, but they already had those features built into massive SaaS platforms. And if they want custom stuff, they\u2019ll pay, but they\u2019ll pay someone with proof. Testimonials. Case studies. Years of track record. Not some new guy with a nice pitch deck. (more on high-budget clients in a min). \n\nIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s no demand. It\u2019s just that for most people, automations are a nice-to-have, not a need-to-have. \n\n**Pivoting to outreach for others**\n\nSo, I decided to do outreach for others since I was good at that. It's just that I didn't have the proof-of-work or credibility to actually get people to pay. That\u2019s when I saw the bigger picture.\n\nThe market is insanely crowded. Everyone is selling the same few things: websites, ads, content, automation. And you can still get clients through cold outreach (it\u2019s not impossible), but the truth is, most of the people you\u2019ll reach have small budgets. \n\nThe ones with big budgets usually go through referrals. There\u2019s this invisible trust loop. If someone is spending 5k or 10k on a project, they\u2019ll just ask a friend or colleague they trust. They don\u2019t care about your portfolio. They care about who sent them your name.\n\nThat\u2019s why personal branding is such a cheat code. \n\nIf you build content that actually reaches people consistently, you create that same trust loop, but passively. Some of those people are just curious about AI, some are caught in the hype, some are serious and have real money, but all of them now trust you. And that\u2019s what makes inbound so powerful.\n\nBut don\u2019t get it twisted. It\u2019s not instant. It takes months of showing up before it compounds.\n\n**AI is not like other \"make money online\" waves.**\n\nEvery big wave before this, SMMA, e-commerce, dropshipping, NFTs, whatever, lasted long enough for you to build something sustainable before the next one came along.\n\nAI\u2019s different.\n\nAI is building itself.\n\nEvery time AI progresses, it speeds up its own rate of progress. The acceleration itself is accelerating. That\u2019s why entire micro-industries pop up, explode, and vanish within months. \n\nYou find a niche, build a clever tool or workflow, and before you even scale it, OpenAI, Google, or Zapier rolls out the same thing as a native feature. An entire industry gone overnight.\n\nAnd sure, some people will say, \u201cYeah, but the custom stuff still has value.\u201d That\u2019s true. There\u2019s always a gap between what a general tool can do and what a domain expert can build for a specific niche. But at that point, you\u2019re not selling \u201cAI.\u201d You\u2019re selling judgment.\n\n**The real moat: judgment**\n\nJudgment is the ability to make consistently good decisions under uncertainty.\n\nNaval Ravikant describes it as compounded experience: you make hundreds of calls, learn from what worked and what didn\u2019t, and over time, your accuracy improves.\n\nYour judgment is what people are really paying for. How many times have you seen a situation, made a call, and had it turn out right? How many times did it turn out wrong? That ratio. That\u2019s your judgment score. That\u2019s what gets you paid.\n\nAI can\u2019t replicate that. It can give you data, but not discernment. And if you don\u2019t have it yet, your survival skill has to be adaptability.\n\n**The vicious rebuild cycle**\n\nBecause every 6-12 months, something drops, a new release, a new feature, that wipes out entire categories of services. Big companies just look at what\u2019s trending, what indie developers are selling, and they add it as a feature in their billion-dollar platforms. They can do that because they have the money, the data, and the user base. And when they do, everyone downstream has to reinvent themselves.\n\nThat means if you\u2019re new, you\u2019re going to be stuck in this constant rebuild cycle.\n\nAnd rebuilding every few months is brutal because even in a stable business, it takes 6-12 months just to find a repeatable offer that works, build your systems, validate your outreach, get client results, and then scale it. By the time you hit that stage, the market has already shifted again.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s exhausting. And it\u2019s becoming less feasible by the month because the buffer period between new releases is shrinking fast (goes back to what I explained about AI's rate of progress). \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the people who are making money right now.\n\nBecause there\u2019s a pattern there too.\n\nA lot of the people killing it right now aren\u2019t selling to businesses. They\u2019re selling to beginners.\n\nCourses, templates, coaching, tools, whatever. And before anyone jumps down my throat, I actually think that\u2019s a great model if you do it right. You\u2019re giving people a starting point, saving them time, and giving them a chance to learn. Even if their first attempt fails, those skills, sales, outreach, positioning, etc., transfer to every other industry. That\u2019s real value.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest about what\u2019s happening. Most of the people selling \u201cHow I built my AI agency\u201d courses made some quick wins in a short window, then pivoted to teaching using their brief experience as credibility and authority. They\u2019re not lying about making money. They just made it in a very different way than you think.\n\nEven people building AI tools and agents are mostly selling to the same crowd: other agency owners trying to automate outreach, prospecting, or client acquisition. The entire ecosystem has become this weird feedback loop where everyone\u2019s just selling tools to help other people sell tools to other people.\n\nAnd if you look closely, most of them are just beginners. Anyone who has actually tried has either made (a small minority, but good for them), pivoted to something else, or quit. \n\nThis makes more sense when you stop looking at it from their perspective and look at it from yours. Every time someone teaches you how to find clients for your automation agency or any other online business, you start doing the work and run into a bunch of limitations and problems. And to fix those problems, you end up paying for software, frameworks, templates, or some system. \n\nThose are the businesses actually making the big money. The ones selling tools to beginners who can\u2019t get started without them.\n\n**The gray zone: fake proof and performative success**\n\nI personally know people (friends, colleagues) who openly admit they fake testimonials, fake case studies, fake screenshots. It\u2019s so normalized now that they don\u2019t even think it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just \u201cpart of the game.\u201d\n\nThere are even patterns you can spot once you\u2019ve been around long enough.\n\n* They\u2019ll say vague things like \u201cI got my first few clients from Fiverr and Upwork,\u201d but never show proof. \n* Or \u201cI just started messaging people on LinkedIn and got clients that way.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s actually done LinkedIn outreach knows it doesn\u2019t work like that. \n\nThey\u2019ll never show real screenshots, contracts, or receipts. Just the same recycled talking points.\n\nI'm not encouraging people here to accuse others of lying or scamming. But I AM encouraging you to ask for proofs and receipts. To be skeptical. \n\nOtherwise, you run into one of these two problems:\n\n**The misinformed optimism\u2013pessimism spectrum**\n\nA while ago I made a post about my own journey on a different sub, and it blew up.\n\nGot a ton of DMs. People said they were inspired, that it gave them hope and motivation, and that they are going to start on the same journey. And that made me happy, but also uneasy. Because I could tell most of that optimism was built on misinformed expectations.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for years. freelancing, selling marketing services, building automations, and I know how long and messy it really is. But when someone new reads a 300-word post and feels \u201cmotivated,\u201d they don\u2019t see that side. And when reality hits, that optimism flips into disillusionment. \n\nIt\u2019s the classic pendulum: uninformed optimism \u2192 informed pessimism \u2192 informed realism.\n\nAnd that ties into the other extreme I see lately:\n\nPeople who dismiss every post as a scam because either they have been burned in the past or the results are too unrealistic for them (their own limiting beliefs).\n\nThese are the equal and opposite of the overly optimistic crowd. One side thinks everything is easy. The other thinks everything is fake. Both are wrong.\n\nA particular pet peeve of mine is people dismissing others because they \"used\" AI to write their post. \n\nA lot of people just dump their messy thoughts into AI to structure them. They have the insight, just not the writing skills. So yeah, it sounds like ChatGPT helped, but that doesn\u2019t make it fake.\n\nIf you instantly dismiss something because it\u2019s well written, you\u2019re probably missing valuable ideas from real people who just used a tool to communicate better. You can probably tell by now that I have done the same. \n\n**Anyway, that\u2019s my rant.**\n\nI\u2019m not discouraging anyone from starting, but if you\u2019re getting into this space right now, just understand what you\u2019re walking into.\n\nYou can still win. You can still make money. But it\u2019s not the fairy tale people sell you. It\u2019s a constant cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine\u2026 as long as you\u2019re honest about what it actually takes.\n\nAnd if you disagree with anything I said, feel free to comment and tell me why. If I'm wrong, I\u2019d genuinely like to know that, so I'm less wrong lol. ",

That\u2019s real value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let\u2019s be honest about what\u2019s happening. Most of the people selling \u201cHow I built my AI agency\u201d courses made some quick wins in a short window, then pivoted to teaching using their brief experience as credibility and authority. They\u2019re not lying about making money. They just made it in a very different way than you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even people building AI tools and agents are mostly selling to the same crowd: other agency owners trying to automate outreach, prospecting, or client acquisition. The entire ecosystem has become this weird feedback loop where everyone\u2019s just selling tools to help other people sell tools to other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you look closely, most of them are just beginners. Anyone who has actually tried has either made (a small minority, but good for them), pivoted to something else, or quit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes more sense when you stop looking at it from their perspective and look at it from yours. Every time someone teaches you how to find clients for your automation agency or any other online business, you start doing the work and run into a bunch of limitations and problems. And to fix those problems, you end up paying for software, frameworks, templates, or some system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the businesses actually making the big money. The ones selling tools to beginners who can\u2019t get started without them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gray zone: fake proof and performative success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally know people (friends, colleagues) who openly admit they fake testimonials, fake case studies, fake screenshots. It\u2019s so normalized now that they don\u2019t even think it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just \u201cpart of the game.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are even patterns you can spot once you\u2019ve been around long enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They\u2019ll say vague things like \u201cI got my first few clients from Fiverr and Upwork,\u201d but never show proof. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Or \u201cI just started messaging people on LinkedIn and got clients that way.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s actually done LinkedIn outreach knows it doesn\u2019t work like that. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019ll never show real screenshots, contracts, or receipts. Just the same recycled talking points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not encouraging people here to accuse others of lying or scamming. But I AM encouraging you to ask for proofs and receipts. To be skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you run into one of these two problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The misinformed optimism\u2013pessimism spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A while ago I made a post about my own journey on a different sub, and it blew up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got a ton of DMs. People said they were inspired, that it gave them hope and motivation, and that they are going to start on the same journey. And that made me happy, but also uneasy. Because I could tell most of that optimism was built on misinformed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been doing this for years. freelancing, selling marketing services, building automations, and I know how long and messy it really is. But when someone new reads a 300-word post and feels \u201cmotivated,\u201d they don\u2019t see that side. And when reality hits, that optimism flips into disillusionment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s the classic pendulum: uninformed optimism \u2192 informed pessimism \u2192 informed realism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that ties into the other extreme I see lately:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who dismiss every post as a scam because either they have been burned in the past or the results are too unrealistic for them (their own limiting beliefs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the equal and opposite of the overly optimistic crowd. One side thinks everything is easy. The other thinks everything is fake. Both are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A particular pet peeve of mine is people dismissing others because they &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; AI to write their post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people just dump their messy thoughts into AI to structure them. They have the insight, just not the writing skills. So yeah, it sounds like ChatGPT helped, but that doesn\u2019t make it fake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you instantly dismiss something because it\u2019s well written, you\u2019re probably missing valuable ideas from real people who just used a tool to communicate better. You can probably tell by now that I have done the same. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyway, that\u2019s my rant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not discouraging anyone from starting, but if you\u2019re getting into this space right now, just understand what you\u2019re walking into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can still win. You can still make money. But it\u2019s not the fairy tale people sell you. It\u2019s a constant cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s fine\u2026 as long as you\u2019re honest about what it actually takes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you disagree with anything I said, feel free to comment and tell me why. If I&amp;#39;m wrong, I\u2019d genuinely like to know that, so I&amp;#39;m less wrong lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Statistically speaking, most of you will fail. Maybe not YOU specifically, unless you\u2019re suggesting all 100% of people who start out businesses can or do succeed, which is not backed by data. The actually data suggests quite the opposite. Most businesses, whether AI related or not, fail. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the person fails. People start multiple businesses. So, even if your business fails, you can always start a new one and apply what you learned from the previous one and eventually succeed, which is what usually happens too. \n\nNow for the other points, again, I DON\u2019T DISAGREE. But my post was about something entirely different. I explained in my post how AI services are different from other services, what kinds of services actually sell well, and the meta ecochamber of b2b businesses selling each other more or less the same stuff, along with some other stuff. \n\nAt the end, I even talked about how many people suffer from misinformed pessimism where they outright discard anything by saying it\u2019s fake or doesn\u2019t work because either they have been burned in the past or because of their own limiting beliefs. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know where you got the idea that I am a dev first and transitioned into sales later.

That's the basic of sales psychology, and anyone spending a proper weekend to learn the basic of selling will know learn that.\n\nRule 1:  Never sell automations, or improvements upfront.  Sell a product.  Sell something fresh and new. Sell something that doesn't replace their systems, but will work with the existing system instead.  Insist that what you have now didn't exist just a few months ago. It's the next super shiny thing. Never tell your customers upfront that they will need to replace their process with yours. That's way too much friction.\n\nRule 2: Sell your product at a price they cannot say no.  Get the foot in the door.  Make them your customer first, no matter what the cost is.  Sell them something that has no friction (lower cost, no need to budget, no need to involve too many people for the decision, no replacement of old existing process).\n\nRule 3: Work on making that customer relation incredible.  Call them and take time with them to ensure their success. Plan a team meeting where you educate them or train them.\n\nRule 4: Sell the automation, the enhancement, the real product, the one worth 10x more, once they are your customer and like the product you already sold to them. It could be linked to the product, but with all the automation and agentic improvements. Have ROI examples to prove your point.  That second deal need to be ROI based.  This is where you sell the real product.  At this point, you are the awesome company, the super helpful guy helping them.  You are in a good position, and you have built the credibility to be taken seriously.  You took the time to understand their process.  Any claim that you can help them make a ROI is taken much more seriously, because you're not just knocking the door with big claims. You are already in, you are already collaborating with them, and they like what you already sold them.\n\nThe big question anyone should ask to themselves, is how to reframe your offer to be able to sell a small product that has no friction during the buying process. Can you isolate a part of your offer and make it a self-contained product that can offer value? You need to have some kind of candy when you knock at the door that they just cannot refuse. The best way to get your customer attention is to give them a treat.",

We\u2019ve through about running ads and even building out our personal brand but haven\u2019t dabbled on either that much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love some insight on how we can improve outreach and talk to more people!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Both open source both catalyst&amp;#39;s for lower cost and real time data ready for AI to make a difference. You can now automate the socks off anything, build anything, integrate anything. Also, if not careful rack up a huge bill for not using the right tools for the job.&lt;br/&gt;\nAI will cost, and it will cost a lot. it is not free and what is free, today, is unreliable and has such small context capability it constitutes a risk use.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exciting times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
