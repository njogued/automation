Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_summary": "Meeting Purpose\n\nTo diagnose and resolve fundamental issues in the company's marketing strategy and execution.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  - Marketing is the primary bottleneck. While franchise growth is strong, DTC marketing is stalled, creating friction between the founder's vision and the team's output.\n  - The core issue is a lack of \"language architecture.\" The team is misaligned on brand identity (luxury vs. \"bougie lifestyle\") and is executing on superficial frameworks, not deep principles.\n  - Feedback must be reframed as principles, not preferences. This provides a clear, objective standard for the team, replacing abstract feedback that causes defensiveness and poor performance.\n  - The email series will be rebuilt from scratch. The current version is structurally flawed, lacking a clear narrative arc and failing to make the customer the hero.\n\nTopics\n\nThe Problem: Marketing Bottleneck & Founder Burnout\n\n  - The founder is experiencing burnout from personally overseeing marketing, finance, and legal.\n  - This is a symptom of a larger issue: marketing is the company's primary bottleneck, while franchise development is thriving.\n  - Franchise Growth:\n      - The team is hitting goals and has a strong pipeline of 47 franchisees for next year.\n      - This success is driven by clear processes and a unified focus on corporate development.\n  - DTC Marketing Stalled:\n      - Marketing efforts are causing friction and are not meeting the founder's standards.\n      - The recent fractional CMO, AJ, is departing for a full-time role with equity, leaving a leadership vacuum.\n      - The founder's heavy involvement is a temporary measure until a new leader is hired.\n\nThe Diagnosis: Misaligned Brand Identity & Flawed Execution\n\n  - The root cause is a \"phase shift\" where the old story is no longer working, but the new one is not yet defined. This creates an identity crisis and a \"no story\" state.\n  - Brand Identity Confusion:\n      - The team is misaligned on the brand's archetype, which dictates the language and strategy.\n      - Luxury: Exclusive, high-end.\n      - Mastige: Accessible luxury (e.g., Apple, Nike), where a $40 product feels like a $400 experience. This is the founder's target.\n      - Bougie Lifestyle: Hip, aspirational, pop-culture-aware (e.g., Flamingo Estate). This is the recommended starting point to meet the market where it is.\n  - Flawed Email Series Execution:\n      - The current series is a \"made-for-TV movie\" that trains readers to ignore it as spam.\n      - Structural Flaws: Lacks a clear narrative arc, a beginning/middle/end for each email, and a defined \"job to be done.\"\n      - Customer-Centricity Failure: The copy talks at the reader, focusing on brand statements instead of making the customer the hero.\n      - Ineffective Length: The 50–90 word length is too short to tell a story or provide meaningful payoff. A 150–200 word range was recommended.\n\nThe Solution: Lead with Principles & Rebuild with Architecture\n\n  - Adopt \"Radical Ownership\" for Feedback:\n      - To address the email series with Bobby, the founder will start by owning their role in the misalignment.\n      - Framework:\n        1.  Own your part: \"I'm reflecting on how we got here; I may not have been clear enough.\"\n        2.  State your needs: Define clear requirements (e.g., jobs to be done, conversational tone).\n        3.  Ask for their perspective: \"What do you think is working? What was your process?\"\n  - Rebuild the Email Series with a Clear Architecture:\n      - Guiding Principle: Make the customer the hero.\n      - Narrative Frame: \"Flowers as a lifestyle decision.\" This is a relatable entry point that can evolve later.\n      - Structure: Each email must have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a defined payoff for the reader.\n      - Tone: Shift from declarative statements to a conversational style that asks questions and reflects the customer's motivations.\n  - Develop a \"Language Architecture\" Codex:\n      - This central document will codify all brand assets to ensure consistency and prevent \"semantic drift.\"\n      - Components:\n          - VTO (Vision, Traction, Ontology)\n          - Brand Guidelines\n          - CEO Manual\n          - Design Principles\n          - Voice & Tone Principles\n\nNext Steps\n\n  - Founder:\n      - Export and send the VTO, Traction, and SWOT documents to Michael.\n      - Restructure feedback on the email series document using the Principle/Core Idea/Message framework.\n      - Schedule a \"heart-to-heart\" meeting with Bobby using the \"radical ownership\" framework.\n  - Michael:\n      - Book the dinner reservation at Pizzana (Marina Del Rey) for Thursday, Dec 11 at 7:30 PM.\n  - Both:\n      - Reschedule the next meeting for Wednesday, Nov 26 at 3:15 PM Pacific.\n",

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:00 - Michael Margolis (French Florist)\n      Hello, Hello, sir.    How are you?    Well, how about yourself?    That's a cheap answer.    I'm not going to allow that.    I'm also well.    Okay, so the kids are sick.    Everyone's fighting cold, but I'm fending it off.    I just had a slight sore throat and runny nose.    But otherwise, yeah, business is really strong.    I don't know if I've shared with you.    I've got an update, which is I am going to be taking on an additional role as an operating partner for an early stage VC fund.    Oh, you planted the seed about that, but I didn't know that it was official.    Wow.    Well, it's like a week away from being official.    We've got conceptual agreement.    We're just finalizing a couple of things.    So it's a VC that has a bunch of portfolio companies.    You get to go in and...    I'm already working with one of the portcos, so I'll be serving.    The rest of the port codes, and then doing some work at the actual fund level, and supporting due diligence.    And then potentially, part of what we're exploring is actually really, like the ultimate expression of this is building a fund, where narrative is actually core to the thesis of the entire fund.    And yeah, it's hard for me to say no.    And it's someone who I've known for a while.    And like, we've done some other work together.    was like, all right, let's, let's, let's get a little closer to this.    So we're kind of going by it step by step.    It won't change anything in terms of I'm continuing with all my work with storied, but it's just bandwidth is okay.    Okay.    Yeah, it's just an equal bandwidth is going to be I'm figuring that out.    I definitely have there's a lot of opportunities that are coming my way right now, both with that and other things.    And as a case in point, I'm working with one of the port codes.    And that work has been so successful that the the    The lead investor for that port code just reached out and was like, hey, can you help us with some of our port codes?    So it's a good ecosystem.    All right.    All right.    We'll keep you posted.    Okay.    Yeah, it's all good.    It's all good.    But so anyway, so if you wanted to ask what's really going on, that's what's going on.    Yeah, that's really cool.    Sorry about the kids and the cold too.    Yeah, such as light doesn't make it easier.    But yeah, exactly.    Yeah.    Okay.    Exactly.    Before we finish up our call, too, let's look at our calendars and see about breaking bread in the next couple weeks.    A hundred percent.    am officially back in L.A.    I'm here.    I'm around.    Okay.    Yeah.    All right.    So how are you really doing?    How I'm really doing is overall, I am good.    It's not a cheap answer.    It's the truth.    But this past month has been the most stressful month this past year.    Wow.    Why?    I'm, you know, I've continued to be stretched as a leader like every day, but, you know, we've started the company from...    The company was losing money.    We didn't have any resources.    I didn't know if I was going to be able to make payroll for like a year and a half straight.    We really had to pinch pennies.    And what was that?    Give me that time horizon.    When was that?    Just so I remember how the timeline was.    2019 to 2020.    Okay.    So about five, six years ago.    Yep.    Yep.    Exactly.    Yep.    And then, yeah, I mean, it's just been like nonstop growth since then, but this is my first time like running a company properly.    And so it's cool.    It's like, I don't know what I don't know, but I'm down to, learn along the way.    so that's gotten me to here at least.    But this past month has been like, I feel like I've gotten the company to where it is today through a sheer force of will.    And I had a come to Jesus moment of I need to like step out the way our company needs process structure.    Like all this stuff that I hate kind of.    And I'm just like, I'm not gonna be able to rewire my brain.    So I need to like, uh, the good news is our.    See.    EOO is like world-class, unbelievable.    And so I just need to step out of the way and like let her lead.    And so she's doing her thing, which is good.    Are you familiar with the whole EOS piece of like visionary and integrator and sort of that partnership?    Totally.    Yeah.    So she is, yeah, we run on EOS.    Okay, great.    Yeah.    Yeah.    So we're like, it's a journey, I feel like, to fully adopt EOS.    We have fully adopted EOS, but like to fully realize it.    So we're, yeah, this is one step closer to like truly.    Did you self-install or did you work with a facilitator on a quarterly basis?    So crazy story.    We were working with an integrator, a fractional integrator.    She was so good.    What was her name?    Out of curiosity.    Her name was Katie.    Katie.    What's the last name?    Tucker.    Katie Tucker.    Okay.    And she was so good.    She went from eight hours and I was like, you got to work more with us.    worked more from eight to 12.    I was like, you got to work more with us.    She went from eight to 12 to 20.    She.    She was so good.    I was like, she's like, all right, I have a couple of clients that I'm like, we'll wrap up with them in a couple of months.    So she ramped up to 32 hours.    And I was like, we need to buy out your contract because she was with a company.    So she became full time with us.    And she was so good with us that she became chief of staff.    And then she was so good with us that she became the chief operating officer.    So this is your COO?    Yes.    Got it.    Look at that.    I love that story.    Right on.    What a great punchline.    Yeah.    All right.    So you have a, you have a, you have a world-class  integrator.    You don't have an integrator.    Yes.    Yes, we do.    So Michael, so with a world-class  integrator, you need a world-class get the  out of the way.    Yeah, exactly.    Yeah, exactly.    So, you know, she, I'm actually flying to St.    Louis.    She lives in St.    Louis.    I'm flying out there tomorrow to spend the weekend with her and just workshop the company in 2026 roadmap before annual planning.    Good.    So, um, but it's good.    Can you share with me your VTO and any of some of the core foundational pieces of having you installed EOS?    You know what?    I'm so happy you brought that up because I didn't know what we should work on today.    I don't know if you saw the email that I sent on the email.    course.    I did.    I replied to it.    Oh, you did?    I haven't seen it yet.    Yeah, I did both in terms of...    So can I give you my candid feedback on what you sent to them?    Yeah.    If I was on the receiving end of that, I'd be like, what the  am I supposed to do with this?    And by the way, I fully support you sort of like throwing the hammer of being like, hey, guys, like there's something, there's some fundamental things here that are missing.    Like you and I are totally aligned on that.    But what you, the way that you communicated it, like my read of it, I was like...    This feels like super GPT with all these poetic metaphors, super abstract, and it just felt very over laborious, and I didn't know then as the recipient of this, and as someone who's already been grinding or putting in the reps, and I'm like, okay, what am I supposed to do with this, or what do I do next?    So I did two things.    One is I quickly ran it through my own GPT around how to make this more concise, more actionable, and practical.    I wanted to model that for you.    Okay, cool.    And then I also gave it the actual current draft of the whole sequence and had it do further analysis on, basically, you'll see this in output B, like strategic recommendations for improving the email series, and broke it down into a little bit more like functional utility.    Mm    In a way that's a little bit more kind of like sort of command line level type of prose.    So just lower cognitive load that's just kind of like, ah, here's the requirements.    Okay, got it.    Okay, cool.    Yeah, I'm reading through this.    Yeah, this is way more like, yeah, it's so noted.    Yeah, I know.    When I send those types of things, it's also, it's like a wholehearted recognition.    Like, there's definitely a better way to communicate this.    But I'm just like, kind of heat of the moment, just throwing my emotions into it too.    Yes, GPT, you know, all of that.    But there's going to be a more effective way to do it.    So I agree with this.    Well, by the way, here's what I want to encourage you.    Because am I correct that what you sent was like GPT'd?    I wrote it.    And then on the sentences that I wanted to like pack a heavier punch, I would GPT one sentence at a time.    But the whole thing definitely was on GPT.    Got it.    It's interesting.    It read like the whole thing was written GPT because there were a lot of these constructions that were like, you know, it's all mechanically correct, but emotionally predictable.    Like it had a lot of these like- Yeah, like that said it was GPT.    Okay.    It had a bunch of these like syntaxual flows, you know, or like luxury does not follow flow structure rules.    Luxury creates world rules.    Like there are these very like abstract metaphors, which a chat GPT can really kind of run away from you if you don't ride the elephant strong enough.    Yeah.    So like, yeah.    Go ahead.    I, yeah, because that statement is like so wholeheartedly true.    And I actually like just on a down to my bones level agree with it.    so like, I like it.    But yes, it reads, it is, it is of chat GPT.    And it reads of chat GPT.    So it loses its potency.    And so I, um, I just want to show.    I'm you my chain of work.    said, take this CEO feedback email below to his marketing team and translate it into something more direct, concise, and actionable.    Less abstract poetic metaphor, more clear diagnosis and solution paths.    Wait, Michael, this is my feedback.    So feedback received, but I need clarification from you further.    Yeah, yeah.    So I'm reading this email that you sent back to me right now, just so I just skimmed it.    wasn't able to read the whole thing.    I will digest the whole thing, I promise.    But when I read it, it is a little bit more concise, a little bit more actionable, a little bit more like, okay, I know what to do next.    Thank you very much for the clear direction.    Um, it allows me to like think through it.    But my my email is puts down the hammer and makes them feel maybe a little bit like .    I totally and that's not my intention.    But it makes them feel something.    Hopefully not like  this guy he's using.    Like, what the ?    But like a lot of times it's going to I don't know if this is  up, but it's going to push the person out of the room if they're not willing to go through this hardship and feel like the brand.    If they're willing to sit down and be like, OK, what is he actually really trying to say?    What's missing here?    And they do read through it a little more carefully and then like put their emotions into it.    And I feel like we'll get a better result because this this this what your response is, it is way more positive in terms of like more positive leadership.    But I feel I feel like they're going to be like, oh, cool.    We know the next steps.    Easy peasy.    Boom, boom, bang, bang.    And like they still miss the like core emotions, soul level, bone deep, you know, like feeling.    So I hear what you're saying and let's talk about this.    So a couple of things.    Remember that people experience change as an assault against their identity.    And the challenge with that is it kicks up a lot of dust.    When you get people into a reactive state that's defensive, adversarial, oppositional, something that makes them feel wrong, bad, judged, stupid, or defensive, 95% of most humans perform worse.    Certainly 90% of most humans perform worse in that dynamic.    Or you end up burning and wasting a lot of calories that are like misappropriated calories.    So look, you were like, hey, Michael, I see what you just generated for me.    I would want to take that and just give it a personal touch and add a couple sentences that's got just a little bit of my, like, my...    Founder passion and sort of call to arms, I'd like, all right, great.    Right?    Like, I got no qualms with that.    But what I'm going to always advise and coach you on is workability.    In the sense of, like, because the moment you make things about right, wrong, good, bad, the conversation's over before it's begun.    Or, like, it just, this is a dynamic that, like, pulls us into, like, all these karmic wheels that creates a lot of discursiveness, a lot of thrash.    And in this situation, you have a team that's already, how many reps have they put into this?    They've been burning a lot of calories trying to get this thing done, right?    Yeah, this is their first pass at it.    But there's a lot of work that went into this first path, a lot of work done in the first path.    Yeah, so there's a lot of work that went into it.    So this is the thing to be mindful of around, how do you not trample on the flowers, forgive the metaphor, while at the same time, letting them know, guys,    There's a higher standard or mark we need to hit, and let me be principled about it.    And the thing I want to reinforce, have I talked to you about preferences versus principles?    We've talked about principles, but I don't know if we've talked about it as it relates to preferences.    So this has been coming up a lot in a lot of different client consults in the last couple weeks.    Because this is one of the places I see a lot of teams thrashing.    I've got another client that we're doing a whole brand narrative redesign.    And with that, there's been a lot of decision making, a lot of debate, whatever else.    Okay, so preferences.    Let me ask you, do you prefer vanilla ice cream or chocolate ice cream?    Chocolate.    Chocolate.    Great.    Okay, so I like them both.    And even more so, I love pistachio gelato.    Preferences.    Right.    Okay, there's a reason why Baskin-Robbins has 31 flavors.    Okay, we each get to have our own preferences.    And too often, when we get into...    Who debates at a leadership or team level.    Everybody starts throwing out their preferences.    Well, I like this.    Well, I like that.    What we need to do is get underneath the why.    Okay.    Well, what's driving that preference?    So, okay.    Whether it's vanilla, ice cream, chocolate, ice cream, or pistachio.    You know what?    The principle for me is a meal doesn't feel complete without just a touch of sweetness on the finish.    Okay.    I love dessert.    I've always had a sweet tooth.    Okay.    So, in fact, I'm equal opportunity.    You want to give me a creme caramel.    You want to give me some rice pudding.    You know, like you want to give me a flan.    Like, I definitely, I've got a bias towards all the mother's milks, so to speak.    Right.    I'm very passionate about it.    But, right.    So, there's difference between preferences versus principles.    Okay.    And what you want to be cautious of as CEO and founder is people being like, Oh, here goes Michael with this.    Preferences, can never please him with his preferences, or I never know what flavor I'm going to get.    Versus, hey, guys, these are the principles.    These are the principles for how we win, right?    Like we run a West Coast offense.    This is our scheme.    Like this is the game day playbook.    Like we have these principles.    And then let's continue to ask ourselves as we're making choices and decisions, how do they ladder back up to these principles?    And then that's what creates a sense of discipline, a sense of transparency, a sense of fairness and integrity for everyone, because they don't feel like the walls keep changing on them, right?    You know, and this is part of what we're working on in a few different areas.    The CEO manuals is another sort of step in that process, right?    But so, because that's the thing.    It's like, all right, man, we've got this visionary founder.    He's really passionate about this stuff.    But man, I don't know how to read these tea leaves around some of these poetic metaphors.    That's how like an ordinary muggle is going to look at this stuff.    You know, and even, you know, and I'm no ordinary muggle, but I read through some of this stuff and I'm like, oh man, if I was producing the other thing and I'm getting this feedback, I don't know.    Many people aren't going to know how to translate and execute.    So that's, that's my take.    Okay, good.    Yeah.    Okay.    Yeah.    Noted.    feel like, yeah, I feel like I could create, because I do have like really, really strong principles when it comes to design that I like that the creative team and I have worked on together.    all in alignment.    So those are good.    And those principles have like helped us a lot.    So I could see what you're saying.    Definitely.    I think like these are almost a different set of design because all of this is creative work.    But maybe there's design principles that are missing or that this email marketing team like didn't have.    And it's around.    Yeah, like, so I would want help trying to translate because there are so many, I feel like there are so many hidden principles in that email that I sent.    I do think that I didn't write anything in there that I didn't, like, heavily resonate with.    So if we could, like, tease out what the principles are and maybe put them in a more utilitarian way.    deconstruct it.    Yeah.    So that's one thing.    The other thing is, so we could do that on this call.    The other thing that we could do is actually look at the VTO.    We're going into our annual planning, and I don't think we've done a good job.    Some of the EOS things are, like, VTO and then the three differentiators.    Like, that's a huge thing that...    Yeah, I would love to iron that out.    think that'd be really helpful.    a general gap in the EOS world that, like, in my constructive feedback.    First of all, EOS, I think, is phenomenal.    It provides process and structure and frameworks, and it has a very minimum viable mindset to, like, let's not over-engineer this .    Let's come up with something that's, like, really straightforward, Fisher-Price building blocks, but that's going to really, like, reduce a lot of thrash.    So I have a deep respect for it.    Thank    Sometimes, though, the Fisher priceness of it means that when people are filling out the different frameworks, that what people come up with, I find, is sometimes kind of superficial.    It doesn't have a level of craft and precision of, you know, the way I nerd out on certain things and the way I think language.    Language is more important than I think EOS gives credit to.    I'll just leave it at that.    Awesome.    I think things need to be framed in even more precise or effective terms.    So, yeah, happy to support you on the VTO front.    Okay, perfect.    I can pull it up here.    Okay.    Pardon me, I'm also getting over.    Okay, here's the VTO that we have today.    Well, this is the VTO section.    So this stuff is, we did this in like, I don't know, a long time ago.    Not a long, well, I feel like we could, yeah, a lot of this can drastically change.    Can I ask, let me ask you a question.    Yeah.    Why did, as part of my onboarding.    why did you not think to share this with me?    It's a great question.    I'm not super duper proud of this work.    So from like an onboarding, a random person perspective, I wouldn't show this.    But for you in particular, I probably should have.    Because I could have been like, this is current state, but I'm not happy with it.    So but yeah, here we are.    Well, here's what I would say, though.    So I appreciate that.    appreciate your honesty.    If you're not sharing it with people, like, you're wasting this work.    And you're creating an inconsistency and lack of alignment or lack of discipline.    Because the whole purpose of this work is, let's build a North Star, where we're codifying certain things, even if it's not perfect, even if we think it's like, okay, this is like, we're just getting started.    But you want to socialize it, you want to keep coming back to it.    Because otherwise, again, people feel like the walls keep changing on them.    Yeah, I think    I think that your onboarding experience is different because you're working with me and I'm like a chaotic, I don't have a process.    But the good news is Katie does have a process in her onboarding.    Her ability to onboard folks in the organization is fantastic.    I don't think she shares this directly with them, this literal page, because maybe those financial data is more sensitive for depending on the person.    But she definitely does like core values.    Where was the 10 year goal?    That stuff, that kind of stuff is shared.    Yeah.    But you did not get that.    And where's the, scroll down, where's the VTO itself?    Yeah, we're on it.    We have core focus.    I don't know.    I guess there's a 10 year target.    Yeah, I guess these are the elements.    Yeah.    I guess this is focus.    Uh huh.    Marketing strategy.    Here are the three uniques.    When's the last time you did a ref cycle on this work?    About a year ago?    More.    Two years ago.    Two years ago.    Actually, we've been in EOS for a year and a half, so it was exactly a year and a half ago, probably.    Got it.    Our company is completely different from where it was a year and a half ago, yeah.    Yeah.    But how come with Kate coming on board, why hasn't this become one of your management frameworks or tools that you guys are managing against?    It is.    December 4th, we have the annual planning and a big chunk of part of an hour is reviewing the VTO and enhancing it.    But candidly, she was looking at me the whole time I filled out this VTO and the organization agreed with it, right?    So, yeah.    feel like this is the vision, right?    This is my job is to have an outside on this, you know?    Yeah.    And let me see the traction side.    Is that sort    Of where you like IDS stuff, or I'm trying to remember what goes in IDS, and traction.    Okay, one-year plan, 90 days.    Yeah, I guess these are all on track.    We've hit our annual goals already this year, which is good, so they're a little outdated.    Okay.    Yeah.    Got it.    Is there a way that, because, like, I know, whatever, 90.io, you know, is one of these that's used for this.    Is there, like, a guest access or an easy way that you can share this stuff?    Like, does it easily export it out?    I guess I see a button for PDFs and stuff like that.    Yeah, yeah, I can definitely export this.    Yeah.    Okay.    Do you want me to, this is open VTO settings, download quarterly export.    I don't know if that is refresh.    Yeah, I mean, it's probably a PDF.    Yeah.    Cool.    Send it to you.    Okay.    Cool.    Yeah, send me that.    Send me the traction one and also the SWOT.    Okay.    I don't even think we've done SWOT.    Oh, I guess we have.    That's funny.    I don't even remember this.    Republican president.    That's funny.    I do not remember doing this.    Okay.    How does that create an opportunity?    That I don't remember doing this?    Yeah, we should.    I mean, our annual planning is that.    So, oh, you know what?    I think it downloaded the entire thing on the first one.    Got it.    Great, great, great, great, great.    Okay.    Yeah, it looks like it.    Cool.    Yep.    Yeah, so I think the...    I mean, here's, I think, a pattern that I'm seeing.    When you ask about, you know, where we might focus or work on, I think part of this is what I call ontology and hierarchy, which has to do with, because you've got a lot of moving pieces.    You're a very passion-driven and principle-driven person.    What most people need, though, working inside your organization, because they're not polymaths, they don't context switch at the speed, a context switch at the speed that you do.    What people need is the, like, waterfall, right?    Like, here's what's at the top of the pyramid, then here's planks, you know, one, two, and three, and then here's the foundations underneath.    And it's just like, oh, and there's a sense of coherence in how each of the layers of the cake basically stack and come together, right?    And it's an exercise in making choices around what matters most versus what belongs on the cutting room floor.    Mm-hmm.    Right?    Like the most important thing is deciding what's most important.    Right?    And it's that whole piece because like complex doesn't scale.    Right?    We got to make the more simple we can make things, the faster you can move.    Right?    And as a founder, founders, we tend to be really, really good at complexifying.    Because we're like, oh, I see all the angles.    And it's also what allows you when other people see obstacles, or walls, you're like, well, hold on, does that wall really exist?    We can go underneath the wall, we can go through the wall, we can build a ladder above the wall, like, right, you immediately go into this multiplex of optionality.    Right?    And that's what makes you a founder.    That's what makes you an entrepreneur.    But typically, you don't, you're not surrounded with people that that same agility, that same dynamicness, and that same throughput of bandwidth of what they can process, internalize and know how to act on.    So real quick then, let's harvest.    What are the things that go into this consideration set for us to build this seven-layer burrito or this multi-layered cake?    We've got your brand guidelines.    That's a very manifesto document.    We have your VTO, which is like strategy, values, and priorities.    Like, do you guys also have, like, you didn't actually show me in here, like, how do you guys handle rocks?    Is that, and do you guys do sort of the, you know, like whatever it's called, you know, your management weekly and doing IDS and all that stuff, a level 10?    Yeah, religiously.    Yeah, we're fully baked in the system.    Yeah.    Okay.    Can you generate a report for me of like...    What's the kind of stuff at level 10 that you guys are dealing with?    Yeah, I mean, I can show you.    I'm more than happy to export it.    But basically, like this past quarter, the two company rocks were to open all the franchise locations and then assign 10 franchise agreements this quarter.    Okay.    A lot of these show off track, but we're, they're like, I think we'll get a lot of these done by the end of the year.    Yeah.    Which air on the side of putting things off track so we can, we just discuss anything that's off track.    Yeah.    So we have like company rocks and then we have, Aaron is in charge of supply chain.    AJ is in charge of marketing.    Danielle is executive assistant and kind of, she does a lot of like culture integration stuff.    Glenn is head of sales.    Katie is operations.    And then I have legal, finance, tech, and then CEO basically.    Okay.    Yeah.    Got it.    Okay, great.    Um, so, I mean, when I just let that sort of like seeing that kind of cascade.    Okay.    Over me, what I'm seeing is a lot of these rocks have been very, like very franchise, franchise driven, a lot of like core infra around corporate, for like a better word, I'd call it corporate development, both the supply chain, as well as then, you know, like pretty much everything in the org is centered around building out the franchise company.    Because that's our mechanism to expand, except for marketing, you'll see that marketing is almost all about direct to consumer, except for this one here.    Okay, got it.    And so here's the thing, I suspect, let me ask you this, when it comes to all the franchise building work, Is there the same level of like thrash and debates, and like you really kind of taking to task the team?    I had a suspicion.    That's why I was sort of asking it.    So, I mean, look, there's some good news there, which is like the drivetrain for the growth of the business from a sort of bit from a corporate development and core infra perspective.    People have like room to run and they're running.    And they're hitting their numbers.    And like you've got really strong pipeline.    You told me about that growth of, was it 47 franchisees that you've got ramping up for next year?    And  amazing.    Great.    Okay.    So, it's marketing.    And the, so a couple of things here, let me ask you this.    What is, what's AJ's title?    So, AJ was our fractional CMO.    He was coming in as our head of kind of.    Growth Marketing.    And it was very long story short.    He's been with us in that role for two months.    I got a call from him two weeks ago.    And he said, I have the opportunity to have a buddy that is running a wine company.    He's been in wine for the past 15 years.    He's offering me the CMO role.    The company is just starting to take off.    He's been trying to recruit me for like three years, but now they're taking off.    He's giving me 20% equity in a way, very heavy salary.    He's like, I have to do it.    So he's still working with us.    He's a very, very high level of integrity.    He's done it in a very respectful way.    But he's transitioning out.    And I think we actually do need to recruit a full-time CMO in that role.    Yeah.    There's a lot of thrash-ish in marketing.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Well, and...    But he has been operating, in essence, as the de facto CMO.    Yeah.    So...    My honest take and reflection back is you haven't been letting him operate as the CMO.    Yes, you're right.    It's wholeheartedly true.    I know it.    I think that over the past two months, I've really been co-leading in a sense, which is not the correct thing to do, but trying very hard to like co-lead in a sense where I'm passing my legacy knowledge to him and then slowly backing off and letting him.    So he's been able to pick up a lot of the performance marketing channels.    He's been a little bit more hesitant on the creative side.    So that's where I've been like having a much heavier hand.    And then now that he a couple of weeks ago told me that he's phasing out, I'm like back into the seat, basically literally back into the seat.    So that's why I sent that email.    Essentially, he's like, I am back into the seat now until we have somebody doing it.    And is everyone else aware of his of his transition timeline?    Yeah.    OK, super transparent.    Everybody's kosher.    Yeah, it is.    Okay.    So yeah, I think just stepping back, I would really consider...    I would be very intentional about anybody that you give a CXO level title to.    And what are the responsibilities and expectations at a CXO level around strategy?    Because my sense seems like a really smart guy, really talented, has this great performance and growth perspective.    But my sense is, you might have taken someone with really deep technical domain expertise around growth marketing, but not necessarily with the skills, the executive presence, or the playbook on how to strategically lead...    We to drive down the field as a CMO.    This is where I'm thinking currently, like I'm doing a huge, trying to spend a lot of time like with the org chart.    So this is kind of what I'm thinking here.    I'll show my screen again.    Now I've got my learnings in from AJ because you're right.    You're a hundred percent correct on all of that.    So you can see Katie's still kind of our integrator here, but we have operations.    She's our head of people to sales, marketing, finance, tech, legal.    So pretty brutal.    I think that we need a CMO here.    We have a- Would you need a CMO or do you need a director or VP?    I mean, I think that's part of what I also want to get to here.    Like, how do you right size the level of experience, expertise, and comp package that fits where you are in your actual growth cycle or maturity of the company?    Yeah, so I have a very-    I have a propensity not to spend.    So me saying we need a CMO is not in character.    You just have to take my word for that one.    Sure.    But the way that I'm thinking about it, too, is we need to optimize for, we need some anchor of time.    I guess it's all arbitrary because we want the company to be around 100 years from now.    Yeah.    So a three-year benchmark doesn't matter that much, but we need something to anchor to.    So if we're making our org chart structure for how do we want to have an optimized 2028 is kind of what I'm looking at, then we need a CMO at some point before 2028.    And so I actually have shifted my mindset into hiring a little bit maybe earlier than what we need, but not too early, but a little bit earlier than maybe we need.    yeah, I mean, I think like in our absolute current state, we don't need a CMO, but eight months from now we will.    And look, this might sound like semantics to you, but like, why not hire a VP of marketing?    So what is a VP of marketing going to do or not?    Let me help you through this org chart so you have the full picture of current state because I am looking to this.    I would love your feedback here.    So this is kind of ideal structure.    We have CMO.    Think of like somebody who really operates with heavy structure process.    They're more focused on the performance side.    They work with that.    Think of like the VP of global digital growth for Domino's.    Domino's is a franchise, has a heavy franchise dynamic.    They're a direct to consumer brand.    Most of their revenue comes from online.    And the fulfillment of that revenue is through physical brick and mortar.    It's exactly who we are mechanically, not from a brand perspective, but mechanically, that's exactly who we are.    If that's the skill set that we need is particularly somebody who understands the heavy franchise dynamic.    So then they can have a...    Same.    Same.    Same.    Same.    Like VP of like performance.    they're in charge of, this is like the growth marketing side.    This is more strategy.    And this is, and then we have a growth marketing manager.    It's like strategy and execution, right?    And then the management of all the agencies and whatnot.    And then we have the creative team.    We have the creative director, an art director, senior graphic designer.    So this is again, strategy and execution.    And we have like a project manager in a sense.    So I'm thinking that like, we don't, if we don't have a CMO, that means we're going to have a performance marketer, a creative director and a project manager, all that cascade up into me managing it.    Cause we don't have another layer to manage it.    And no, again, again, I don't, I don't disagree with you that you need a marketing executive or a marketing leader by all means.    I'm just pointing out.    It doesn't, it doesn't, need to be a C title.    Yeah.    In terms of, that's all just that.    And I, and especially look, you, you have such a, you know, you are a benevolent dictator.    Like you have a very strong personality.    You don't even.    Like, this is just head of marketing.    This is head of operations.    Katie, please call her the COO, but it's head of operations, essentially, right?    Got it.    Cool.    Because, by the way, I'm a big believer.    So Facebook has this philosophy, especially early on, which is, like, you have to earn your VP titles or your CXO titles.    Like, you don't just walk into the place like that.    And I think for where you're at right now in this notion of what you're trying to download and onboard, I would – because here's the thing.    When you give someone that's – especially give them the CMO or CXO-level title, and then you're hovering or you're being, like, you know, like, you're really on top, like, sort of, you know, micromanaging, it sends a lot of confusion around ownership, right?    Right?    And so I think you're just going to have a better dynamics of setting up and managing expectations of, like, coming at a VP level or – Thank    know, coming at an SVP level, I don't know what the , but like minimum VP level.    And it's like, I need you to be the operator for this department or this division.    And your job is to, you know, basically be consultative, draw out of me the strategic requirements, and the foundations that we need to put in place.    And part of your growth and progression is ultimately then, you know, being, you know, basically earning your spot amongst truly being, you know, a peer CXO, you know, in the executive leadership team.    Yes.    Yeah.    Yep.    I agree with all that.    Yeah.    That makes sense.    Yeah.    So until that time, I'm like sitting in a lot of those seats there, right?    So with Flavia, we just had an offer signed earlier today with Nika.    Yeah.    Congratulations.    Yeah.    And that's for the art director or a different role?    For the art director.    Yeah.    Great.    He just made the idea as well, which is like, it's fantastic.    Yeah.    So he took a nice leap there.    And I think it'll be like a great adventure for him.    And where's he based?    He's in Chicago, which is fine.    All of our team is remote.    So it's all good.    Yeah, yeah.    Got it.    Yeah.    So how much do you get?    You're sitting in all these others.    You're also sitting in the seat of finance and technology.    And then what else?    Finance, tech, legal, and marketing.    Finance, tech, legal.    So what percentage of your week goes to finance, tech, and legal?    Well, we just brought in another layer of tech.    So as of a couple weeks ago, that took like 85% of my workload off.    And they're honestly doing a phenomenal job, running away better than I was.    that's great.    Great.    So now moving forward, maybe like 20%, 25% of my time on those three.    Got it.    And within finance and legal, which is the one that's most    Finance is the heavier hitter.    Legal is a little bit more reactionary.    We are pretty regulated as a franchisor, so there's some work that we need to put in there, but it's not.    just have six attorneys, like a contracts attorney, a franchise attorney, a labor attorney, and so it's just like, I just need a triage and they do the work.    Why is it your head of ops able to do more of it?    Jesus, her plate is even more full than mine right now, so I'm happy to take it.    In the long run, we would need an in-house general counsel.    Understood.    Understood.    Okay.    Okay, and then what about finance?    Finance is not there.    Finance is, that's my background, so I'm able to do it pretty.    We have an accountant, bookkeeper, and like an analyst that I use to do some of the work.    It's not hugely taxing, but again, in the long run, we probably need like a fractional CFO.    Even through 2028, we probably don't need a full CFO.    Yeah.    Okay.    It's really like ops and marketing are like our big hairy functions.    And finance is a big hairy function too, but like I have that under control currently for the next six months at least.    Oh, that's why your stock options are taking  forever is because like I'm the only person that can do that.    Yeah.    Got it.    That's why.    If you saw my note, by the way, like we just go back, keep it on the individual side, keep it simple.    And yeah.    Okay.    I have it.    It's pending with me.    Cool.    Cool.    Okay.    All right.    So back to marketing.    Yeah.    So we have the brand guidelines.    We have VTO, strategy, values, priorities.    What else is the inventory that needs to be part of this kind of North Star Codex?    I think it's really interesting or important to come up with this because Katie, as good as she is, and she is remarkably good at operations, I do hear things from her sometimes where it's like, why is it taking us so long to design apparel?    Can't you just put the logo on the shirt?    Just  do it.    And it's like, yes, we could easily do that.    And if we need a stopgap, then like, sure, let's do it.    It's fine.    But like, ultimately, from a marketing perspective, we want to create some sort of apparel that feels special, right?    Not for the outside world, but also.    In addition, for the person who's wearing it, choose the better material.    We don't have to approach this with literally every single thing we do, but let's pick the key things that are going to be the moments of impact, and apparel should be one of them for us.    It's just those types of things.    The website is wholly utilitarian to her.    The user experience doesn't really matter as much.    There's a reason she's in front of ops and not in front of marketing.    So I do want her to...    The communication of the VTO and the principles that the whole company operates by, which is create world-class moments, needs to apply to every department, not just us.    So I think honing in on this VTO would help everybody in the organization.    And with marketing, it's not a  show, but it's close to a  show.    I feel really positive about the direction that it's going because I'm willing to spend the money to figure it out.    And that's new.    It's like pyre.    A recruiter, get the right people in place, step aside and let them do their thing.    So yeah, I'm like on that trajectory for sure to learn the skill and development of learning about like what's happening.    Well, and I think this notion of creating world-class moments, which I love this as a, like, this is where we put, you know, flags in the ground.    And then the question is, how do you stack rank and prioritize where to spend that money, where to burn those calories?    Because you can't make everything world-class, right?    Like part of being an entrepreneur and part of being a hyper-growth scale-up is actually building your tolerance for all the imperfections and things.    Basically, you accepting things, not being where you want them to be.    And that that's okay because you recognize the trade-off and that there's more important things that we need to focus on.    Thank you.    Thank Yeah.    I have no problem with at all.    But what I don't want to lose sight of is like, here's my magic wand aspirational state.    Totally fine that we're not even close to that, but this is what we need to work against or to work towards, right?    Yeah.    Totally fine with the in-between.    Yeah.    Okay.    So we have brand guidelines.    We've got the VTO.    We've got a CEO manual.    We have, I mean, you've been working on this email series and website redesign.    Is there any kind of a creative brief or set of principles guiding those?    Like, what's the, like, what, like, like, what's the strategy that informs how people are making decisions on both of those?    Is there some doc that codified that or sort of set the, set the goalposts?    Yeah, kind of.    I sent, I remember those like design principles that I sent you.    That's right.    Yep.    Design principles.    Okay.    Yeah, those were like some of the design principles that we definitely talked a lot about as we were creating a website.    Yeah, but there was a lot missing from there that we like realized through the creation of a website, like make the customer feel like the hero, that love is the ultimate narrative.    There's a few things that are not in those design principles that should be integrated.    Yep.    Yeah.    Uh-huh.    And then, is there anything codified around voice?    I mean, I know there was that like, there was that doc you shared with me from Bobby that just had a bunch of riffs.    Right, right, didn't, that, see, that was an example to me, that document felt like preferences, not principles.    Right, right, right.    Right?    It just had like, oh, here's some selects of kind of some phrases that I kind of like.    Right.    But there wasn't a sense of what are the principles or the codex behind it.    Yeah, so when we went through all of those lines, it was like Bobby.    Yeah, don't like any of these except for one, because there's only one in here that makes the customer the hero of the story, right?    So we were able to, like, sift through that document pretty quickly through those principles.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Uh-huh.    How did he take that?    He rips me apart, and he takes it pretty good, too.    He took it just fine.    Okay.    Yeah.    Cool.    So, I mean, I'm assuming he probably has the biggest thumbprint on this email series, right?    Yeah.    Yeah.    So how do you think he's taking this?    The email?    Yeah.    He's the only person that can handle the feedback.    That feedback was meant for him.    He's the only person that could, like, handle that and read through, like,  this guy versus, all right, let me sit down and understand what he's really trying to say here.    Mm-hmm.    I think, hopefully, you know.    I mean, again, like, just playing...    Armchair psychologist, and I say this with like zero judgment.    My observation of my small interactions with Bobby is that he is a very binary oriented person that is very, that's very reactive or quick to be like right, wrong, good, bad.    And someone that's wired in that way has a hard time with ambiguity or shades of gray.    Yeah.    And while you may feel that he has the kind of the resilience and the like, he's a  warrior, he can  take it.    Right.    And that may be true.    I, I would suspect it also comes out of cost.    You know, I don't, I don't know that he has, I don't know that that psychological construction is well built to, to really metabolize that in a way that didn't come at.    I'm also like cost or deficit going below the line.    Yeah, definitely.    No, I hear you.    I do.    Yeah.    Yeah.    And look, and there's no, and I share this stuff with you.    This is not, there's no right or wrong to this, right?    Like these are all just choices.    I just want to support you in continuing to build your, your awareness and observational capacity to be like, hmm, action, reaction, or like, what choices am I making?    What reverb is it having?    Is this, is this, is this the, is this the right thrash or the wrong thrash, right?    Like, where do I want to tip the table?    Where do I want to nudge people, you know, back on the path?    Things like that.    Yeah, it definitely, it's, it's so interesting because sometimes it is like, people aren't going to take this well.    It's not a positive thing.    It's going to come at an expense, but like, I know I'm tipping the table.    And I'm like, I don't see a better alternative because I need our approach to be fundamentally different here.    I don't need incremental improvement.    We need a fundamentally different approach.    And if it creates thrash, I'm okay with that expense.    But there has to be a healthy way to do it.    Yes, surely.    Yeah.    that's what I would say to you is, and look, part of what I'm sharing with you, I've learned the hard way.    So three years ago, I had 10 full-time staff, was running a professional services agency.    And I was a little, hopefully benevolent dictator.    And I was a hot  mess because I was pulled into all this operational thrash stuff.    And I struggled with being able to, like, well, why don't people just get it?    Right.    Right.    And I had such a strong clarity in my mind, but I didn't always know how to articulate it.    Generative AI wasn't, like, utility where I could, like, have it download, translate, process, synthesize, reflect.    In the ways that we can now.    So it was just so much more thrashy.    And what I've come to learn through the process for myself, as well as with lots of executives that I coach, is if you can reduce your own emotional reactivity, and it's okay to be like, hey, guys, look, you know, I'm sorry to have to say this, but like, we're just not there.    Or I have some real legitimate concerns about X, Y, and Z.    But then give it to them in a straight, non-emotional manner that's very principled.    And that actually increases people's receptivity of how fast they can take it in.    And they'll be like, oh, okay, I never, I didn't think of it that way.    Oh, okay, that makes sense.    Because what most people want to do is they just want to perform.    They just want to execute and excel and achieve and know they've done a good job, but they're not good with ambiguity or abstraction.    Right.    Right.    So they're just like, oh, okay.    Like the things that are obvious to you that are implicit or not explicit to them.    It drives me nuts working with designers and things like composition, hierarchy, balance, foreground, background.    Like I'm just wired to see all of that.    And sometimes it's like I've had to learn not to get emotional.    I'm dealing with a designer.    I'm like, hey, this is  fundamentals, man.    Why do I have to point this  out to you?    Right.    Like this is just fundamental basics of universal design.    But by naming it, I depersonalize it.    It's not about my preference.    They're these principles.    And I want us to make choices based on these principles.    And they're like, oh, okay.    I respect the principle.    And like.    This is what I was helping the whole design team with this other client that was like, they went some off-roading and they were doing some things that were running away.    And the rest of the executive team that's on my Tiger team that I support, they didn't have the fluency to know how to give the design group the feedback they needed in order to get to the outcome, right?    So, you know, but by making it principled, I mean, we just had a meeting earlier today and I was like, great work, guys.    Like, we're sticking this landing and this is  badass.    Awesome.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Okay.    Yeah.    And then so, okay.    Yeah.    So basically lead with principles.    Yeah.    Lead with principles and then really clear actionable behaviors.    So what does this principle in action or this principle applied look like?    Yeah, I feel like I have a hard time.    Like, one of the things is like, I can give them the principles, but...    They're actually better at the work than I am.    That's why they're doing it.    And so I can give them examples of other work that, but I can't, I don't really know how to give them like actionable next steps other than giving them a point of reference.    I can give them a point of reference.    So here's the beautiful thing.    Generative AI is  genius at this.    So for those of us that are very abstract and principles driven, give it the principles, give it the context or the use case, like give it enough background context of like to what it needs to be applied.    And it's really  good at order of operation, like next indicated action.    Okay, cool.    And it breaks it down in a very linear step-by-step progression or stakes things out at least at 70%, 80%, 80% good enough as a scaffold that then you can be like, oh, great.    All right, now I know I just need to tighten this bolt.    I need to adjust this thing.    Or similarly, your people can do the same, but it gives them a scaffold of putting it on the rails.    Okay.    Yeah, that's helpful.    Okay.    Yeah, yeah.    But yeah, because this was one of my historical blind spots for like literally most of my life.    Like I realized I'm technologically super savvy, yet I'm mechanically inept.    Like I do not think in a linear manner and progression at all.    And that's my gift.    And it's also my curse.    And AI has saved my life.    Yeah, great.    Saved my career.    Like it completely transformed my career and how I do work now because, oh, great.    I can have someone else go.    Like that's where I burn so many calories.    It doesn't come natural to me.    It's totally adaptive capacity.    Okay.    Yeah, that is really good.    All right.    Yeah, it's wild.    What's that?    It is wild.    The tools that are available like that weren't three years ago even.    It's not sad to think about.    So how do we get, I mean, the thing that's most central to me is how do you get this email series back on the rails?    And.    Oh, I want to talk about origin story with you too.    Like origin story is more to be found in this email flow.    Yeah.    We want to put the.    We want to put the customer at the center of the journey.    That is the highest principle.    so one might say, well, who gives a  about your origin story?    I would say that it's not really about our origin story.    It's about this is how we came to be.    And this is what our philosophy is.    And it's more of like asking the client if they identify with that philosophy so they have something to agree or disagree with.    So it's still about them.    But we're sharing.    Yeah.    Okay.    So I do feel like there's time and a place for the origin story.    Yeah, absolutely.    But let me ask you this from a process perspective, like structurally.    So this email series, did you or Bobby or AJ or someone else do any quick foundational research on what are the archetypes of a nurture series?    Or like, what are the common frameworks for when people build a nurture onboarding series for DTC?    Like these are the common elements and what that arc looks like.    That for sure was done.    Yeah.    AJ and our email marketing agency, like that's their bread and butter.    So Fathom is building on their framework or their best practices kind of thing.    Great.    Well, so here's the thing is I would go back to basics.    I would go back to, hey, let's go back and revisit that framework.    I just agree with that.    Because in my email, I said like, it's clear that we know how to follow the rules.    That's kind of what I meant by that was like, we're following best practices for an email welcome flow.    But it's a little bit too apparent.    Like now that we know the rules, it's like, it's a six email series.    There's a, you know, here are the common things that you do.    And it's like, okay, like, well, here's, here's the reason I'm bringing this up is so to you, it may feel obvious.    I want to go back to, well, what are, what's the framework and the underlying assumptions that we are building with and make them really.    It's explicit because you're making an assumptive leap that actually, yes, that framework is going to get us to where we want to get to.    And I want to go check and verify because you had a framework and the output is way off on signal in terms of us getting to where we want to get to.    So I'm just trying to basically deconstruct going all the way through the assumptive chain to then recognize what do we need to recompose?    At what place is there a potential breakdown?    So I just want to check and verify.    I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel.    Great, if there's a great framework and if it logically makes sense to you and everyone else, okay, cool.    Great, it's not a framework issue.    We're trying to diagnose where in this whole construction things are breaking down.    It's a framework issue.    It does go back all the way to the very start.    That's fascinating.    That's what I was suspecting because when I was going through the series, it wasn't clear to me what jobs to be done is happening in each of these beats.    I mean, it sort of was.    But not in a way that was creating.    It just felt very superficial and very transactional.    And like, I'll put it to this way.    If this was a storyboard for a trailer of a movie, it felt like a made-for-TV movie that's kind of like a middling seat.    I wasn't like, ooh, I want to watch this movie.    Ooh, I know what's going on here.    Ooh, what's going to happen next?    oh, great.    There was no payoff to each email.    Totally.    Right?    Like, so it was sort of like, okay, I hear your lips are flapping.    Okay, great.    But like, and like, you're basically what you're doing is you're training the reader to consider this spam.    Because we're not giving them a payoff.    There's no clear emotional payoff and or behavioral payoff to each of the emails.    So I'm, you're basically training me to consider this as noise in my inbox.    Yeah.    Which to me is the count is literally the counter effect of what you were trying to do in a nurture series.    Yeah, 100%.    Okay.    Yeah.    How would you suggest?    So let's look at the...    And by the way, I know we're at the top of the hour.    I don't have a hard out.    How are you?    I'm okay.    Let me take a quick peek.    Yeah, I'm fine.    I'm fine.    Okay.    All right.    Why don't we go up to the next half hour, to the half hour, if it works?    Okay.    So the first thing that was really unclear to me is these two journeys, for themselves or for someone else.    Like the labeling in the document is not clear.    Like, what are we talking about?    Really not clear to me, both the flows and the like, yeah, it just, it wasn't clear.    And then, and or like, how are you distinguished?    Like, what's the trigger to know which flow people go into?    Is one of them personal flow and one gifting flow?    Is that, this is sort of what it inferred?    Yes, I think...    Right now, it's like zero-party data where we actually ask them, is this a gift?    Are you purchasing for yourself or as a gift?    So we actually get that zero-party data.    Got it.    Okay.    So for instance, this to me is much better labeling, personal flow versus gifting flow.    And then it's like, okay, based on that flow, there's different jobs to be done or different goals that's driving that experience.    Right.    So this is the kind of stuff.    And again, this is, you know, my chat GPT.    This is just going to be directional.    Like, you know, you need to kind of take this and tighten the bolts and adjust where necessary.    The, okay.    So that was one.    Then install a conversational frame.    So yeah, much of the current copy reads like statements, rewrite with the reader in mind, ask questions, acknowledge motivations, reflect who the customers are.    Becoming spoke to emotional intent, not product attributes.    Let me, by the way, just pull back up the series that we can context switch between the French Florist.    Here we go.    So establish value, brand story, and offer.    So this is an example.    This to me, like, that's not clear and focused enough.    That's actually saying three different things.    Value, brand story, and offer.    Right, right, right.    Yeah.    Right.    Yeah.    What's the one thing?    You're right.    That's actually a very, that is one of our actually written design principles is like, singular focus would be singularity in your message.    So that it was not followed.    Okay, great.    Right.    And then number two, build emotion and mindset.    This to me is super abstract, could mean a thousand different things.    This is not a clear job to be done.    Now it says flowers for any reason.    I think it means like no reason is the best reason to buy flowers on a random Tuesday because that's more impactful than...    But you see, this is like, it's so concise.    It feels like a drive-by.    Right.    Right.    You're basically like, we're like, we're yelling at, we're like, we're screaming at people running down the hallway.    Right.    Like there's no beginning, middle and end to this, to this, to the arc of this email.    Right.    There's no story.    Yeah.    There's no story, right?    No, it comes out of nowhere.    And it just like, it's very declarative.    Flowers are for any day, any reason, or even no reason.    That's the best reason for them all.    Let beauty in, let's like, I feel like I'm just being blasted.    And I have no idea.    Wait, where am I?    Like, what's, what's the context for this message?    Um, right.    So it's just like, it's very, it's very much like, uh, like, yeah, I feel, I feel like I'm just being blasted.    Um, and if we go back to the first one here, yeah, I'm going to write, welcome to the beautiful world of flowers.    So this feels very like poetic.    Um, but it's like, there's so much poetry in every word that I'm like, like, I need more functional utility.    I need just more like action doing words or basic, um, we're community who must be surrounded by flower.    Like we're, we're opening with really big abstraction.    We believe in the power to uplift, enhance, beautify, elevate, respect, get okay.    You know, now I feel like we're gilding the lily.    kind of barfing in my mouth.    We source the best flowers from the best frames all around the world.    Okay.    Yeah, sure.    are.    And there are.    Designers are trained through our own studio program, arrangements meticulously crafted and elegantly designed.    I'm like, who are we talking to and why do they  care?    This is my welcome message.    And I'm talking in a pure unadulterated way to use a please, filter and censor this, right?    But the, yeah, it's just like, I'm basically, we're making a bunch of statements.    And how do these statements actually, why do these statements matter?    Why should the reader care?    Like, how are we, how are we talking to them?    Right?    Our designers are trained through our own studio program.    Like why, like, like, I mean, the question I would want to know is why, how did this make it into email number one?    Like we have six sentences and this is one of the six sentences.    Like.    Like, what are we trying to communicate and establish with the reader here?    Right?    So it's just like, so to me, there's just a lot of structural questions that it brings up of, like, what's the actual job to be done in each of these emails?    That's why, like, framework-wise, I was like, I don't know what we're trying to do here.    Right?    It's a lot of, like, very jointed, disconnected fragments.    You know?    Each sentence on its own is poetic, and it's like, okay, it's a nice fragment.    But, like, I don't understand beginning, middle, and end, what story is happening in each individual email or going through the whole series.    And we continue to, like, we're talking at people from arm's length.    Like, like, even the way, you know, small gesture they can make to...    They feel extraordinary.    It's like, there's no you.    Like, we're not writing in second-person you.    It's very abstract arm's length.    And in a way that can feel like you're kind of just lecturing or talking at people and past people.    You know, versus like the power of flowers.    Like, and by the way, like how many, hold on a second here.    This is, tool, word count.    You know, so like, I would want to know at a principal level, what is the logic behind 55 word emails?    Like, is that, is that intentional?    Like, is that empirical data driven?    Because they feel like drive-bys, you know?    You just did a word count on it?    Yeah.    I just did a word count on this one, including the word CTA, but it came out as 55 words.    Oh, okay.    And I don't know if this is meant to be    Like, hey, look, this isn't the full email.    This is just, like, the general conceptual kind of, like, here's some of the key messages.    And then, actually, we have to layer in a little bit more copy.    But that's not being, that's not communicated clearly.    Right?    Like, and it's, like, I'm all for a short email, but, like, my gut would say, like, make them 150 words.    For instance, you know, where you actually have room for a beginning, middle, and end.    And, and, like, the power of flowers, like, this is a perfect, a perfect, like, way to start, like, to introduce a story, like, the power of flowers, like, tell me a story here.    You know, that's, like, something personal, something, something emotional.    Um, you know, whether that's, you know, whether that's introducing you as, as, as founder CEO, or some other potentially another character, um, you know, or, or, you know, introducing the designer in the flower studio as the character.    But like, I feel like more character driven type pros, because you're, you're talking about craft.    Like that's a huge theme that arcs through this whole thing.    But there's no sense of like making of, and we're inviting you into the making of, and what creates the magic and how we want to bring that magic to you.    I struggled with the character thing of it.    Um, yeah, because I liked what you said, and then I started to think a lot more about it.    And yeah, I don't know if I got thrown off by like, um, where my some of the reference points that I pull are other luxury brands, whether that's right or wrong.    Um, it's interesting to look.    Some of the best brands in the world, and craftsmanship is such a key component of those brands, but they don't have characters.    They will tell the stories of their craftsmanship that stitch the fine leathers together, but there's no founder.    It's not a founder story, right?    Yeah.    So maybe it's about our designer.    Yeah.    And, and, or also, like, back to your point, make the customer the hero.    So, like, the power of flowers, like, you know, when's, like, you know, when's the first time you were ever given a flower?    Or, you know, what's the best bouquet you've ever been given in your life?    Like, there's a way you can ask questions that basically invites them to be exploring their relationship with flowers.    Versus, this is very declarative, where we're basically telling them the answers, instead of actually.    Stoking the fire about their conceptual and emotional relationship with flowers.    Does that make sense?    Mm-hmm.    Okay, designed with intention.    So similarly here, there's a way where I feel like you're making assumptions.    And you're making an assumption that your customer wants things designed with intention or meticulously crafted, that like they know the value of this.    And then you're alluding to pain points, but you're not naming or illustrating the pain points.    Right?    So no aggregators, no anonymous.    This online marketplace is no outsourcing.    The meaning of that is not telegraphed to me.    don't immediately get that as a reader, right?    But there are these pain points in the typical flower experience, which is like my fear that what I, the picture that I see online, like that the actual product isn't going to measure up to that for myself or for someone else.    Like, it's like, you want to, we want to name the objections themselves and they needs to be emotional and visceral.    And then we present our, this is how we've solved against those things.    But I feel like we're naming a bunch of value props here, no aggregators, online anonymous marketplace, no outsourcing.    Those value props are not obvious to the reader.    That, oh yeah, these are what my pain points are.    Like you're sharing inside baseball here as a consumer.    I'm not thinking about aggregator on, you know, online marketplace or outsourcing.    Right.    But what I am thinking about is like, let's, let's say this is, I mean, this is the one for, for some, this is the one for the gift, right?    For someone else.    Oh, wait, no, this is for themselves.    Yeah, this is for themselves.    So it's like, what I want here is, like flowers that deliver on the promise.    You know, like flowers that don't disappoint.    Right.    Like there's nothing like, like, there's nothing like the feeling of impeccable immaculate flowers and what that can do to the room.    Equally, there's nothing worse than getting a disappointing bouquet or something that's like wilted or like subpar.    Right?    Like, now we're stoking the fire.    We're getting to this emotionality of, like, I want this, I don't want that.    And we're showing empathy.    Right?    We're like, we're really, it's far more visceral versus this larger abstraction.    Yeah, love it.    Bring beauty home.    Flowers that brighten high.    Surround yourself with flowers that inspire and amaze.    So, again, through here, like, like, I read this and I'm like, why not just make an email that's like, flowers, it's a lifestyle decision.    Like, give them a sense of pride of like, man, like, you are cool.    You are hip.    You're a...    Like you're in Zen, you're in flow.    Like some people just know like everything in life is better with flowers, right?    And if you're that kind of person, you probably care about this, this, this, and this.    Well, this is how we make sure to deliver on that, that, and that.    It's like we're involving them.    It's about their story.    It's about their journey, their expression.    What are you thinking right now?    Are you typing something up?    Yeah, I'm typing.    Yeah, I am also thinking.    It's interesting because we're taking like a, like we're, we're providing feed.    You're doing it.    This has blown my mind.    You're so good at this, Michael.    It is a little bit interesting because we're building on what they wrote and giving them feedback on it in a very tactical way.    So if I was on the receiving end of this feedback, I'd be like, oh, my God, this is such actionable, incredible feedback.    And I'm just going to go and literally implement it, but I'm not going to go back to that framework level and think I should rebuild this flow using the principles.    Right.    Like we're giving them the answers here.    Yeah, but look, and this is again, this is the art of feedback and the art of of stakeholder engagement or management.    If you give them the answers, that's not motivating.    Or collaborative, and especially if you have a strong personality, creative director who kind of owns this copy and they're going to look at this.    And if they're already in a reactive state, they're they're not processing.    They're processing this as, wait, what the  are you talking about?    Like, wait, what is this little riff and missive, everything in life is better with flowers?    Like, it's like, we have to literally go through and label the stuff.    That's like, hey, I think the theme of this email might be something that's like, everything in life is better with flowers, or like flowers is a lifestyle decision.    Okay, and then make the body copy, something that's built around, well, if you care about this, this and this, and it's not about actually our philosophies.    Because you're now making it about you, it's actually put yourself back in the shoes of if someone if you're someone who's passionate about flowers, what is it you as the consumer care about?    All right, and we want to name the things that's the like the details and the stuff that they really matters to them, that often doesn't get to.    Yeah, what could be interesting here is like maybe, Michael, alongside this feedback, we list like the one or two principles that we're trying to follow too.    So they understand like the tactical feedback of the suggestion here, plus the principle that the feedback comes from.    Yeah.    So like in this one, like the principle is about make it about them.    They are the hero, you know.    Mm hmm.    And I would offer that those riffs of flowers as a lifestyle decision or, you know, and like flower, like everything in life is better with flowers.    Sort of gives them two different high level narrative frames.    Yeah, I feel like I want to I push the I push the lifestyle one even further that like flowers are they're not even they're like beyond a lifestyle.    It's like a life force of like it's because it's of love and love is like a life.    Yeah, but that you're just that you're you're you're a visionary ahead of your time start with lifestyle.    Really?    Yeah.    Okay.    I don't disagree with you, but that's like, don't let that swing for the fence get in the way of like, let's move the runner, just advance the runner here.    And flowers as a lifestyle decision can be a mantra call to arms that you can just own.    That's up for grabs and it's really relatable.    It's just the way in which anyone tries to build a lifestyle brand.    And like, Hey, we're, we're the company.    If you believe that like flowers are a lifestyle, like consumers can very quickly wrap their heads around that.    And yes, as part of the more advanced education, let's talk about the healing power of flowers.    Every flower teaches us something different.    There's a life force that there.    Oh, we can get into all these other layers, but like meeting consumers where they're at flowers.    It's a lifestyle decision, man.    You know, and, and, if you want to, if you want to be that person, or you already are that person, like we're the V.    Let me give you a really simple example of this.    So what's his name?    Mackie.    What was his first name?    So the founder of Whole Foods.    I'm blanking on his first name right now.    Something Mackie.    Okay.    Whatever it was, 30, 40, 50 years ago now, he came up with a really powerful insight.    And the premise was, you know what?    I think there are more people who care about where their food comes from and how it's made.    Right.    Really simple.    Right.    Like thesis and first principles.    And then so he created the vehicle.    He created a specialty supermarket for those who believed in, I care about where my food comes from and how it's made.    Right.    And in that process, he stimulated not just the success of Whole Foods, not just the success of like organic.    Natural Foods and Produce, but like became one of the bellwether brands that led to the entire like organic natural wellness rev of  Lucian, right?    But it started with a basic premise, right?    And it's like, and that's, and the most powerful brands, consumer brands do that, which is there is this underlying value.    That's like a cultural value seeking expression, but it doesn't have a vehicle or pathway for that expression.    So let's now build a brand and a product that gives people that vehicle.    People will then self-select if that matches their existing worldview.    Take liquid death, right?    So liquid death was like, look, we think there's a whole bunch of people who don't want to be drinking alcohol or sugar, but they want to have a fun beverage and a really enjoyable beverage.    And one that doesn't make them feel like a wanker just sitting there holding.    And by the way, have you ever tried Liquid Death, like just the classic sparkling black can?    It's some of the best  sparkling water I've ever had in my life.    And I'm really picky.    I come from the food.    My dad was a food technologist, worked for Nestle.    I'm really good at it.    They  formulated that sparkling water in a way that was just like, , that's good sparkling water.    But then it comes with a can that just has the most brilliant branding on it.    And so what is it doing?    It is a vehicle for the expression of a lifestyle and an identity.    And it's why it played to so many people, too.    And it sort of has a little tongue-in-cheekness to it and sort of like, oh, yeah, I'm a cool kid.    It's got the insider vibe, but it also is a great product.    All right.    So anyways, like just like flowers as a lifestyle, like is a really simple thing that I would strongly advocate because it's it could be a normal.    Star that a lot of like your people will like you can for CPG and for DTC, like, like this, that's not some weird, crazy abstraction.    Right?    Yeah.    Right.    Like, okay, we have a lot of other reference points.    How might we now go for the category flowers, like really be like, we're the company for flowers as a lifestyle.    Right?    It's simple.    And yet there's so much room on that canvas that you can color.    And, and play with.    So much room to run for everybody on your team to like, go to  town.    Yeah.    Okay.    Bring beauty home.    Um, I mean, so this right here, like, I mean, I feel like the biggest thing through all of No.    Noo.    This is, I don't know who's talking and who you're talking to through this whole series.    Like, who's the narrator and who's the audience?    And how do we make this, you know, like, like in a way that actually feels relational and connective?    Like flowers, flowers, more flower, like, is, does this, and also you have this real challenge.    There's this fundamental creative tension that's going through right now, Michael, which is, are we a luxury brand?    Are we mastige?    Right.    Or are we sort of this third thing, which is this like fun, irreverent, playful brand that, you know, is kind of like pop culture hip.    And I don't think, I don't think that's clear throughout this copy of like, what is the.    Like the brand persona, both for the brand and then for our audience.    And which of those three archetypes is this?    Luxury, Mastige, or, you know, cultural hipster?    I think, I don't know what Mastige means, but I think we're that.    Oh, you know what Mastige, so Mastige, let me give you an example of Mastige.    So Mastige, like the company Cody in the fragrance world is Mastige, where they basically are taking references to luxury, and they often are doing like white labeled licensing of a lot of celebrity names.    But ultimately, it's a mass consumer product that's being sent out through like, you know, retail channels.    And so it's Mastige, it's like affordable, it's like accessible, affordable luxury, even though it's not luxury, but it's sort of, it's, you know, it's aspirational.    Yeah, I feel like, like, I like to compare.    I feel like Apple is the brand that has been    I think I told you this.    It's probably not politically correct.    So for the note taker, please omit the following.    Like the richest billionaires in the country have an iPhone.    The poorest people in the country largely also have an iPhone.    Yeah.    It's really interesting because it's not like I don't see that as politically incorrect.    Yeah, but I mean, it's just weird to think about the whole thing is like a very interesting topic in and of itself.    But outside of that conversation, the iPhone is an extraordinary piece of value that's created in people's lives.    Again, outside the debate that you can have there.    But and it's positioned as a luxury product.    But like it's it's is that Mastige?    Is that luxury?    Right.    And so it's for us.    I make the comparison.    We're like we want to when I go on a rodeo drive and I'm looking at like the apparel for inspiration.    It's a $4,000 long sleeve t-shirt.    They go and serve me champagne.    It's like.    Cool.    Interesting experience.    But we want to be able to have somebody come in and spend $40 and feel like they just got a $4,000 experience.    And I feel like Apple has been able to kind of do that.    They are selling a $1,000 phone, but if that phone costs $30,000, you'd have people buying it.    I think Nike used to be that way, too, where you can pay $100 for shoes, and they feel like $500 shoes compared to what the competition was putting out there at the time.    So it's not quite Mastige.    It's not quite luxury, but that's how I would aim for what we're doing.    It's like the chocolates that we're creating, did I send them to you?    I think they're so beautiful.    No.    When you and I get together, we're going to have a chocolate conversation.    We'll actually have a chocolate tasting.    Okay, good.    As a matter of fact, if you know good chocolatiers that we should work with, it could be an opportunity.    Yes.    I told you I used to run a chocolate secret society, right?    Yeah, I know a little bit about it.    I don't like your secret society.    I do want to...    Yeah, some Illuminati .    Yeah.    So I like how do how do we put that in?    First of all, let's get we'd love to get your feedback on it.    Second of how do I like because I feel like sometimes people do ask me, like, are we luxury?    we not luxury?    And so I have to tell them a story of like, this is these are reference points of also like who I view on French Florist.    Well, look, so let me let's step back for a moment here.    And here's what I would say you're you're in the midst of a phase shift, right as a company, for sure.    And when you go through a phase shift, the story that got us to here isn't the story that gets us to next.    You're right now in the messy middle, right?    Okay, because we're not no longer in the old story.    We've left the place of comfort and home.    We haven't arrived at the destination of the promised land in the new story.    And so when you're in that liminal place, you're out in the wilderness, and it's the place between old story and new story.    Is no story.    Oh, interesting.    And so we have to deconstruct in order to reconstruct.    And it creates an identity crisis.    Interesting.    Right?    And so we're seeing the symptoms of it right now.    I think the call out that I have for you is for you to identify that and evaluate who amongst your team and crew within marketing or that's touching marketing has the capacity to way find through the jungle.    Who has the capacity to actually zoom out, take the balcony view, approach this in a first principles manner, in a very strategic manner, and not get lost by just narrowing down into pixel craft and lose the big picture.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Our art director is very, very principled based.    He's pretty good for us.    Yeah.    Uh huh.    Um, but I, I mean, look at the risk, at the risk of over speaking or overstepping here.    Um, but I know you like it really straight and you like to hold, pull no punches.    Um, uh, I look at this output.    And if I was, if this was, if I was sitting in your seat, I would be having a real heart to heart come to Jesus conversation with the leader that put this thing together, especially if that's someone that's not a junior employee, but is like operating at a, at, you know, that's really at a leadership level here because like, I just like, I don't get it.    I don't understand what, what was the logic behind the decisions that we're being.    And like, where's one's head here?    Like, what is this beginning, middle, and end?    Who are we talking to?    How are we talking to them?    And like, what is causing such a fundamental misalignment?    Or like, we're so far off from structure, like having the right structural architecture, right?    This isn't about preferences.    This isn't about semantic, but like, oh, you know, I'd use this other word choice, or like, there's something about this thing that it's just like, you know, or is this meant to be an outline that then one creates the copy?    Right?    And it's so it actually doesn't have the layers in of the, like, because the syntax, to me is what is so off.    Like, I don't understand how this is direct to consumer syntax.    And I'm not a DTC guy, right?    Like,    I'm not a copywriter.    mean, I, you know, I moonlight, I play one on TV, like I can, I can armchair quarterback, I can do this, but like, you know, I shared, and like, you know, my AI model is not trained on DTC, right?    So I get, there's an art and science to it, but I know enough to be able to be like, okay, what, what is, what's off here?    And, and how did we get to this place?    And so, and it's less about deconstructing or litigating, but it's more of, of what do we need to do in order to get back on track?    And how do we reduce the, this thing being so far off target at a structural level, or being clear about jobs to be done, or like a beginning, middle and end to an individual email or a series?    Yeah.    Yeah.    Okay, perfect.    Love it.    I appreciate you saying that.    I mean, think this, yeah, I like, I think a real heart-to-heart would actually go very far away.    And can I give you some quick coaching on how to approach that kind of conversation?    Yeah, please, please do, please.    Um, so I would strongly encourage you to practice radical ownership and start by owning what is all yours.    Perfect.    Right?    So because that's a way to basically deescalate, like, hey, look, I want to, I think we need to have a heart-to-heart.    I've been really reflecting on this.    I've been trying to think about how did we get to where we are right now?    Um, because I feel like we're, we're really, there's something.    really, uh,    Like some real fundamental structural stuff that's getting lost in translation.    It's not stylistic, but it's real structural.    And, you know, and I think, like, I want to apologize.    I think there's some things, I'm wondering if I've been getting in the way, or if I'm, or if I wasn't clear enough in me really setting and defining expectations, right?    But make it about you taking ownership.    Right?    And then, and then in the process of that, talk about, about workability, about what's not working through all of this, and what you need in order for it to work.    Right?    And then let him respond to that.    So it's not about what he didn't do.    It's not about making him wrong or bad.    It's about you taking radical ownership, especially as you've been, you know, riding hard.    Into the marketing group and kicking up dust and whatever else.    And, you know, it's like, okay, maybe I'm sending mixed messages.    Maybe I'm sharing.    Maybe I'm giving you guys too many ideas.    Like, you know, like, assume the best.    Put it on you.    But then name the requirements of here's what we need in order to be successful on this thing.    Right?    And, you know, and with that in mind, you know, what are your thoughts about what we need to do in order to hit those requirements or, you know, in order to get to that place?    And then, you know, you can then have a coaching conversation with him as well as also an evaluative conversation around alignment and workability.    What do you, reflect back to me your takeaways from that sort of, what do you hear from that that resonates?    Um, yeah, I've definitely seen in practice too, like if I, uh, it's really like the drama triangle thing that, you know, yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    As opposed to, uh, like trying to be the hero or like just be, uh, or instead of victim, exactly.    Yeah.    So no, I mean, I've seen it in practice that what you're saying is like, absolutely true.    Um, the one part that I, so I think I can do that easily in.    And start off the message is start off the meeting in a strong way where they like kind of disarms them.    That's good.    The workability part is what I'm trying to think through a little bit.    Like I don't have as much practice with like, okay, great.    I have set up the set up the meeting in a good way.    Now, like how do we leverage that?    So talk to me more about workability.    Yeah.    So workability is start by naming your needs.    So here's what I need.    Right.    And, and be very, structural as possible.    Right.    I need us to have really clear definitions.    you.    Of the jobs to be done for each email, and the overall email series, and what informed how we put, like, how are we thinking about this arc?    Like, what is this dramatic arc?    What best practice or what guide, where is this coming from?    Okay.    And I want us to be really intentional then about when we look at the jobs to be done for each of these emails.    Are you still there?    Your video for us?    Yeah, I'm here.    Okay, okay.    All right, for whatever reason, your video for us?    Yeah.    Okay, so then, okay, you're back.    I'm freezing again.    No worries.    Okay, so.    Okay, I'm It's fine.    All right, now you're caught up.    So.    Okay.    Yeah.    So it's like, because it's like, we want to be super intentional of, like, what is the payoff to the reader in each email?    Like, let's go back to even even- Like,-    All the way at the beginning, the purpose of a nurture or onboarding series is to do what, right?    And like you say, it's about building trust, relationship, a connection, okay?    And what people are expecting and are used to is the moment I buy something, I start getting spammed by the company I bought something from.    So we need to make sure that there is true, meaningful payoff in each email.    Otherwise, we're just training them to look at our messages to spam.    So now let's talk about the different kinds of payoff.    One payoff might be to get them to feel something.    Another payoff might be to get them to think of things in a new way.    Another payoff might be like to reaffirm, oh, yeah, I'm in the right place.    You get me.    You get what I care about.    Another payoff is, oh, man.    would be.    this    All the way at the beginning, the purpose of a nurture or onboarding series is to do what, right?    And like you say, it's about building trust, relationship, a connection, okay?    And what people are expecting and are used to is the moment I buy something, I start getting spammed by the company I bought something from.    So we need to make sure that there is true, meaningful payoff in each email.    Otherwise, we're just training them to look at our messages to spam.    So now let's talk about the different kinds of payoff.    One payoff might be to get them to feel something.    Another payoff might be to get them to think of things in a new way.    Another payoff might be like to reaffirm, oh, yeah, I'm in the right place.    You get me.    You get what I care about.    Another payoff is, oh, man.    would be.    this    This company is the answer to my prayers or is the platform for the expression of this identity or lifestyle.    But we got to really think about these psychological drivers and motivators, right?    And all of that's up front and jobs to be done.    Then here's another thing that you need.    I think you need that each email feels like we're in conversation with the reader.    Because right now, it feels like we're talking past them in a whole series of fragments that are great, great little ideas.    They're these short little packets that like, yeah, that's all part of the conceptual world of our business and our brand.    But the syntax of it, I feel like we're just blasting the reader like a drive-by that is like in one ear, out the other.    And I just don't know what just happened.    I don't know where I am.    I don't know what this is about.    And so also, you know, another need might be, and this isn't quite a need, but it's kind of a recommendation.    I think concise is good, but, you know, what would, you know, like, and then you can start asking questions like, help me understand, was there a rationale or a logic to like 50 word emails or 90, you know, this one, I guess is 90 word.    I mean, look at this, this is still even just 90 words.    Okay.    That's not much economy of language, there ain't much to do here.    Right?    Like, I mean, even 150.    So I mean, I would sort of ask this question of like, even thinking about a range of emails that maybe go 150 to 300.    Right?    Or 150 to 200.    Like, give some room to breathe where you can, you know, So another thing would be, how do we approach each email with a clear beginning, middle and end?    There's a sense of like, what's the hook or the opening?    What then is the body of this thing where we kind of click down into something that illustrates the hook or the promise and the premise?    What's the payoff?    And then where are we taking people?    And kind of a natural sense of waterfall or cascade.    So those are a few examples.    I think then there's also the, I need us at a leadership level to get clear or aligned on, are we architecting this language system as a luxury brand, as mastige, or as a kind of pop culture, kind of like hip lifestyle?    And because those are three very different genres.    And I actually kind of think of the three.    that we're actually, you know, here's what I would call the third one, actually.    So number one, luxury, number two, mastiche, and number three, bougie lifestyle.    Yeah, it's kind of like, you know Flamingo Estate?    No.    Oh, check out Flamingo Estate.    It's a killer brand.    If I have the chance to pick up a book, I'll gift it to you.    It's a great coffee table book.    The best I've seen.    Okay.    Yeah.    Their email flows are wonderful as well.    So go pull some of those email flows and ask your team to deconstruct them.    Like, what is it about these that are working?    What is it about this that creates a relationship with the brand?    right reallyأن can the moment.    Amazing.    Mm-hmm.    Oh, where are we?    Over here.    Okay.    But yeah, I mean, my overall reaction to all of this is like, I just don't know where we are.    I don't know where we're coming from.    I don't know where we're going.    And, you know, and then to your point, if you're having this real heart-to-heart with this person, I'd be like, and obviously I wouldn't lead with this.    Let them, give them a chance to respond and kind of hear their take, see what they take ownership over.    And if they're being really defensive and not taking ownership, you know, I might say to that person, you know, I got to be honest.    I'm kind of disappointed because I believe that this work doesn't represent your...    So I'm trying to understand with that in mind, and what you've shown me in the, maybe, you know, he probably has a track record and he's shown you.    Are there other reference points of work that you've been really happy with?    Oh, his?    Absolutely.    Oh, yeah.    Yeah.    Great.    Like, what's an example of that?    I mean, no, he's done a lot of remarkable work.    The entire brand guidelines are his.    Okay.    Yeah.    Right?    So like, anchor back to what are the positive reference points of the work that you really love and are proud of, right?    And then be like, what do you think is happening?    Why are we getting, why is this getting so muddled or lost in translation with, with, you know, is it email as a specific format?    Is it something else?    Is it something in my blind spot?    Is it something I'm doing that's, that's, that's, that's making it difficult, know, that's getting in the way, like, you know, and it's, it.    It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's    It creates this balance of ways you can really call someone else out by also continuing to be like, is it me?    What is it that I need to be doing?    It's very disarming, you know, and yeah, for you to really get a sense of like someone's growth mindset and the ability to like problem solve together, right?    Because there's always going to be bumps in the road.    There's always going to be things that like, okay, this isn't quite what we were hoping for, or okay, like this isn't this, this isn't quite on the mark.    You know, like, how do we continue to keep growing and learning together?    Like, that's, that's kind of the, the mindset and the approach I try to bring to every, every coaching, every coaching conversation and any client conversation.    What do you, what do you internalize or take away from that?    No, I think it's absolutely phenomenal.    Like using this as a platform to like recognize that there will always be bumps in the road and like, let's fix this issue, but I'll see as it was delivered.    We're going to create some amazing principles.    There's going to be clarity for all of the future work that we get to create.    think it's an awesome opportunity.    It's great.    Yeah.    It's great.    Yeah.    And, and yeah, and then in the process be like, you know, like what, and you might ask him after you share that upfront, like what's, you know, what, you know, Hey, here, here's what workability, here's what I need.    You know, like maybe ask him, like, what's your, you know, what's what, like, like, what's your take?    Like, what, what, what do you think is working in this email series?    What do you think is essential for us to preserve and protect?    Like, help me understand your, help me understand the process and what, what you're kind of tending to here.    Right.    Cause he's a real, he's a real passion, visionary dude.    Who's got strong, strong POVs, like great.    Like, and you're, you love strong opinion, loosely held.    Right.    So you're like, great.    Like, give me, give me your editorial take on this.    All right.    Cause you might be like, Oh wow.    I love that.    Oh, okay, but this is where it's getting lost in translation.    All right, let's give it this nudge, you know?    But yeah, understand what's the underlying logic by which he went about solving for all this.    Cool.    I know we're way over here, but...    That's been fantastic.    I appreciate it every moment.    Good.    Okay.    All right, last thing.    Pull up your calendar.    And how is...    How's the week of December 1?    How is even that night, Monday the 1st?    Okay, so the 1st through the 8th is a bunch of, like, annual planning kind of stuff.    Ah, okay.    So I'll be out.    Is this for lunch?    Or for dinner?    I was thinking, like, a dinner or some time after work.    dinner?    Yeah, yeah, yeah.    So we'll do the evening.    So let's see.    The 9th is a franchise event.    The 10th is a franchise event.    The 11th...    Um, 11th or 12th is open or the following week is pretty free.    How about we do Monday, the 15th?    Uh, right.    That's the only day I can't do that.    No worries.    The only day.    So let's, let's, let's go back then.    Why don't we do Thursday, the 11th?    Um, yeah.    Are you good for that?    Yeah.    Okay.    Are we going to Pizzana?    Yes.    Yay.    Yeah.    Pizzana.    Let's do it.    Let's do the Marina Del Rey one.    Yeah.    Easy.    Uh, I'm very flexible on time that evening.    What, what's good for you?    Um, if you're flexible on time, I would say 7 30.    Um, um, and it'll help me.    Um,    With doing some bedtime with my girls, but I could also do it at 7 if we need to.    7.30 is fine.    Okay.    All right.    Let me, I'll go and make a reservation right now.    Marina Del Rey.    Cool.    This is, it's on Lincoln?    Yeah, exactly.    Yeah, perfect.    Two guests on the 11th.    No, sorry.    Fifth, or Thursday the 11th.    That's right.    Thursday the 11th at 7 p.m.    Come on, little birdie.    It's taking a while to load.    We must be having a server issue.    It's just loading, loading, loading on Resi, but I'll leave it open.    I'll get it reserved, and if not, I'll have my EA set it up tomorrow.    There's plenty of time out.    It'll be fine.    they can get busy, so it's good to just have the reservation.    Okay.    That'll be in their place.    Are we scheduled regularly?    Are we good for at least the next meeting?    Let's check or confirm.    I don't have no idea what it is.    Yeah, I've got us two weeks from today.    Oh, okay.    So that day I am in annual planning, we will need to shift that.    Do you want to try to have...    I'm playing here on your EA's name, nice guy, though.    Do you want to have the...    Do you want to have...    So I can't do that day, but do you want to email?    I can coordinate, Danielle.    I hope can help us coordinate with your EA.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.    No problem.    Okay.    Yeah.    All Let me send an email and we'll reschedule that one.    No problem.    Next week is a bit of a short week because it's Thanksgiving, but do we want to try to wedge it in next week or do we want to stack it in the week of the 8th?    Um, I wouldn't mind doing like even a Wednesday morning, like Wednesday at 11 a.m.    Pacific.    It's the day before Thanksgiving.    It's totally up to you.    Um, what can I do?    I'm already committed at that time, but I could do, I could do more so end of the, towards the end of day.    Like I could do a 3 p.m.    on.    We're technically 315 on Wednesday, if that works.    Let me take a look here.    Yeah, I think that sounds good.    Let's do that.    315 Wednesday?    Is that good for you?    Yeah, yeah.    Yeah, yeah.    I'll make that.    Okay, cool.    So let me...    Oh, wait.    I think the way I need to do it is I delete December 4, just that event, and then we're going to go custom.    315.    Charts.    So grade.    Awesome, Michael.    I have loads of notes.    That was a great session.    Thank you for that.    You're welcome.    Um...    The...    The...    So let's keep thinking about and prioritizing structure.    Yeah.    Structure, structure, structure, right?    Like, or actually, here's a better word for where you are and where you want to go.    Architecture.    Yeah, that's great.    Yeah, I'm reading the book for example, Organizational Design.    And it's about like the architecture of the company, of the org chart.    And yeah, that's interesting.    Yeah.    Okay.    And we have to start using, think of language as a system.    Language is architecture.    Just like you need a data architecture, just like you need a design system.    Yeah.    We have to treat language the same because in also the world of generative AI now, language is the new enterprise code base.    All right.    But 99% of companies and organizations don't have a language system or aren't aware of the language system.    And the amount of semantic drift or the amount of basically tax.    And like...    Like friction and drag that's happening through the whole system because the lack of that language architecture.    So interesting.    Okay.    Yeah.    So we're doing something that can be durable, something that actually becomes scaffolding that allows you to build velocity and scale.    And because remember, working with AI, your outputs are only as good as your inputs.    So if we're not disciplined and precise enough on the codex, on the North Star, it becomes recursive and it just basically keeps adding noise downstream.    It's pollution.    So this is why getting to the essence, getting to the fundamentals, providing the first principles are so critical that then both AI and your team can then actually build with.    Mm-hmm.    Yeah.    I like it.    Okay.    All right.    Yeah.    We'll keep down that rabbit hole.    That's a good one.    Cool.    I like it.    Awesome, Michael.    All right.    I'll you next week.    Thank you.    Yeah.    One last tip for you.    I would encourage you, if you're willing to put in the time, what I would do is try to go back into the comments that you put into the doc and put some labels.    Deconstruct each of your comments with functional labels.    What's an example of one?    Like what we did with, what I mean by labels is like, I'm trying to find one you wrote here.    I feel like we've adjusted.    Where was the one?    Ah, okay.    So like, go to the one that said    As everyone in every everything in life is better with flowers.    Yeah, about it.    Yep.    Okay.    So, so the, you know, the principle, and by the way, principle here would be LE as opposed to AL.    And I would move that up to the top.    Oh, thanks.    Right, move that up to the top.    So the principle make it about them, they are the hero.    And then, and then I would then maybe put in the next thing I would go, you know, like, core ideas.    Colon.    Everything in life is better with flowers.    And, you know, period.    Flowers as a lifestyle decision.    Okay.    And then, you know, like, create another break.    And the rest of this stuff be like, you know, sort of, like the message, or sort of, or not the message, like, like, like, of, kind of, I don't know, maybe I would write read.    Redirect or kind of what we need, you know, sort of like focus or basically like without saying this, but an internal note, even though they are even more than that, they are love, a life force.    Like, I don't know.    See, that reads scatological to me.    Like, that's so stream of consciousness.    Like, that's an example of like, I don't know how to read this tea leaf, Michael.    What the heck are you saying?    Yeah, I know.    If I'm hanging on to it for dear life there.    Let it go.    Let it go.    So I would, I don't, I don't know what you're trying to, to litigate or make what point you're trying to make there.    Let's, I mean, if you're willing to hash it out for a sec.    Yeah.    I, I wholeheartedly agree that like, it's your version of saying it ahead of its time.    And I think that I could communicate this to Bobby.    just need to find the right way to communicate it to him that like, we want to, that bougie lifestyle.    Um, is the right, like.    Meeting the market where it's at a little bit more.    It's easier for people to understand.    But I do want even Bobby to understand that I don't view flowers like that.    There is something beyond that that I believe in.    But isn't that in the brand guidelines?    And that's still in the codex.    Why does it need to be spelled out at the individual email level when we're actually saying, here's what I need you to focus on in this email.    We need to really articulate flowers as a lifestyle decision.    So you're basically complexifying by then saying, oh, yes, but don't forget about this, this, this, and this.    And you're basically then creating this cognitive load that's creating noise and discursion versus, ah, the command or the request is flowers as a lifestyle decision.    Okay, that's my brief.    Let me go execute on flowers as a lifestyle decision.    And yes, in the ontology, by the way, at a brand level, what are we saying?    Flowers are love, right?    And like, that's there.    That's like a.    Parent thing that needs to apply to everything, but like by bringing it back in here, it's like, wait, okay, wait, so what am I supposed to do?    Yeah, interesting.    Yeah.    I don't know why that one's tough.    Okay, yeah, I have officially updated it.    And then, so then this last piece, so if you, it's not if you care about this, this, and this, our philosophy.    So I would put a colon in front of all of that.    And then I would say, I would put, I would put message colon.    All right.    And then it's, you know, it's, so it's more of like, basically, like, if you are a flower enthusiast, if you, if you believe in flowers as a lifestyle, you probably care about this, this, and this.    It's not about our philosophy, and it's not that we're right for you.    We just need to affirm their identity and the things they care about.    we'll start.    Thank you.    So if you're a flower enthusiast, what was the second one you said?    like the second one.    So if you're a flower enthusiast, you probably care about this, this, and this.    And then that means we're right for them.    So I would get rid of our philosophies.    We're right for you.    I would just say we're involving them.    It's about their journey.    It's about their expression.    And then we are a vehicle or a platform for their expression.    That's the end of that paragraph slug.    But we're not, we're not then trying to force our philosophies, our ethos, or trying to prove something to them.    We're just, the best way we prove it is by telling their story.    , you guys really get me.    Yes, exactly.    Like, that's, that's what I'm about.    That's what I want to represent.    That's the life I want to live.    Those are the scenes.    This is the environment I want to curate, blah, blah, blah.    Yeah.    So just notice the structure to this.    We have a principle.    We got some core ideas.    We've got message.    And so this is far more structural with the right labels and context and focus that you can actually behaviorally really create buy-in.    even if someone doesn't necessarily believe in the same thing, they can see the underlying logic model or rationale where they'd be like, okay, well, I would have had a different taken approach.    But, okay, if this is the job to be done, if these are the components, I know how to execute against that.    All right.    All right.    Well, I'm going to work probably for the next half hour.    So I'm going to see if I can transform the other bullet points here.    Yeah.    Take, take, take.    Take a stab at a few more of them and then tag me.    me a little ping by email to let me know.    I'll take a quick look at it in the next day, too, and then I'll see if there's any other kind of low-hanging fruit ways that I can be of support on this.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Okay, beautiful.    When are you going to have a sync and debrief with Bobby?    Probably, let me see my calendar tomorrow.    Probably it's going to end up being Monday.    Okay.    Oh, yeah, it's going be Monday.    Yeah, actually, Monday or Tuesday, yeah.    Cool.    I would encourage you maybe cut proactively.    What about reaching out to Bobby tonight or first thing tomorrow?    Like, hey, how's your schedule Monday or Tuesday?    Why don't we have a sync or realignment, reset, debrief, whatever's the right word?    I already sent it.    I already sent it when you were suggesting.    And I did it in a nice way.    was like, look, the email had one or two, and it's about me owning my  for it.    But let's debrief, let's realign, let's get to understand how we did.    done.    Great.    Awesome.    All right.    So yeah, ping me once you've done this.    I'll take a quick look in the next day, and then let me know how Monday, Tuesday goes.    Okay.    Awesome, Michael.    All right.    You're the best.    Thank you.    I'll talk to you soon.    You're welcome.    Bye.    Bye.\n",
