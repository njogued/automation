Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_summary": "Meeting Purpose\n\nRefine the longevity real estate narrative for investor and buyer audiences.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  - Shift from \"Transformation\" to \"Dynamic Destination\": The core message will pivot from the potentially intimidating term \"transformation\" to \"Dynamic Destination.\" This tagline addresses buyer fears of boredom and commitment by framing the property as a constantly refreshed, active environment.\n  - Lead with the Money Model: The primary hook for both buyers and investors will be the financial value proposition, not the longevity thesis. This strategy de-risks the investment by highlighting the property's unique rental income potential and comparing it to the highly profitable Four Seasons residential model.\n  - Build a Multi-Threaded Narrative: A detailed narrative architecture will be developed for two main audiences (buyers, investors) and their sub-archetypes. This will provide a \"buying committee\" story, enabling champions to secure buy-in from partners or managers by addressing specific motivations and fears.\n  - Align Brand with Core Thesis: The holding company name, \"Relevant Partners,\" will be re-evaluated to better align with the longevity thesis. \"Relevance\" was suggested as a more refined, active, and \"old money\" alternative to the current name's \"new money\" feel.\n\nTopics\n\nThe Narrative Challenge: Overcoming Disbelief\n\n  - The current longevity thesis is strong but risks overwhelming audiences and inviting skepticism (\"too good to be true\").\n  - Goal: Simplify the story, making it digestible and grounded in tangible value.\n  - Strategy:\n      - Humanize the Story: Focus on healthspan and practical lifestyle choices, not \"snake oil\" or utopian sci-fi.\n      - Pace the Reveal: Lead with a compelling hook, then introduce the full longevity stack as a \"choose your own adventure\" for those who want to go deeper.\n\nThe Solution: A Money-First Narrative\n\n  - The primary hook will be the financial model, which de-risks the investment and provides a clear, logical foundation.\n  - Key Financial Drivers:\n      - Short-Term Rental Rights: A unique advantage in the Valley, creating a high-demand, low-supply rental market.\n      - Breakeven Model: Solves the common owner problem of high costs for low usage (e.g., $10-15k/month for 6 weeks/year).\n      - Membership Revenue: Annual fees ($2k–$5k) from non-owners accessing amenities.\n      - Retreats: Bookings from external gurus hosting events.\n  - Framing: Compare the model to Four Seasons residential, which generates high-margin revenue from villa sales while owners cover operating costs.\n      - Positioning: \"Luxury hospitality with a unique differentiation\" (the longevity thesis).\n\nThe Solution: A \"Dynamic Destination\" Experience\n\n  - The tagline \"Dynamic Destination\" directly addresses buyer fears of boredom and commitment.\n  - Rationale: The property will be constantly refreshed with new events, music, and curated experiences, ensuring it \"never gets old.\"\n  - Community: The property's tighter home density is a deliberate design choice to foster active community interaction, avoiding the empty feel of typical gated communities.\n  - Influence: Ownership provides a platform for owners to host friends and build their social capital, creating another value vector.\n\nThe Solution: A Multi-Threaded Narrative Architecture\n\n  - A detailed narrative architecture will be built for two main audiences: Villa Buyers and Investors.\n  - For Each Audience & Sub-Persona:\n      - Key Questions: The 5–7 core questions they need answered to gain conviction.\n      - Motivational Drivers: What they truly care about (health, family, image, etc.).\n      - Fears: What they are most afraid of, which the narrative must de-risk.\n  - Purpose: To provide a \"buying committee\" story, giving champions the tools to secure buy-in from partners or managers.\n\nThe Brand Identity: \"Relevant Partners\" vs. \"Relevance\"\n\n  - The holding company name, \"Relevant Partners,\" will be re-evaluated to better align with the longevity thesis.\n  - \"Relevant Partners\": Perceived as a \"new money\" statement with something to prove.\n  - \"Relevance\": Suggested as a more refined, lyrical, and \"old money\" alternative that evokes a sense of ongoing cultivation.\n\nNext Steps\n\n  - Scott:\n      - Create a narrative architecture for Villa Buyers and Investors.\n      - For each, define 3 sub-personas with their key questions, motivations, and fears.\n      - Detail the financial model for each longevity product/service.\n  - Michael:\n      - Use Scott's output to build narrative architectures for each persona.\n  - Both:\n      - Meet Monday at 4:00 PM to review the architecture and refine the decks.\n",

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So slick and sleek.    And we're like, can we even eat this?    It looks like, you know, it's like a piece of work of art, like modern art.\n  00:00:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I know.    When I saw it, I was like, that, that is my holiday signature gift.\n  00:00:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It just is like, shablam.\n  00:00:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I was like, I opened up, oh, of course it's Michael.\n  00:00:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I didn't even see the card because my wife had it at first.    And I was like, that's Michael.    I just love that.\n  00:00:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, you really, like, you need two people to like carry it into the room, right?    Oh, it's so cool.\n  00:00:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Two people on their shoulders.\n  00:00:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's like.    Totally.\n  00:00:32 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Love it.    Because it's like, it was what, like about, it's like two and a half feet, three feet.    I'd say, oh, I'd say, yeah, about two and half feet.    Yeah.    Two and a half.    Yeah.\n  00:00:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      At least.    Yeah.    Genius.    It was so genius.\n  00:00:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    and nice, nice box.    And yeah, it's, it's great.\n  00:00:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I was at a question based on the videos too, because I actually, I haven't sampled that specific product of theirs.    How, what's the size of the truffles?\n  00:00:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      They are.\n  00:00:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Were they large or are they just average size?    Like that big square.\n  00:00:59 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:00:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But that's.    But it's bigger than, say, typically a truffle will be like three quarters of an inch by three quarters of an inch.    It actually looked like it was more like inch and a half by inch and a half.\n  00:01:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, it's much bigger than that.\n  00:01:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's almost like mini brownies, right?    Like really each of them can be like three or four bites that you share.\n  00:01:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There's two sample.    There's two of each type.    So we're like, oh, okay, great.    There's four of us.    We'll just cut them in half.    And that's plenty.    Yeah.\n  00:01:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?\n  00:01:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, they're great.    They're good sizes.    They're not like little mini teeny ones.    They're like, they're not sus.    Yeah.\n  00:01:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's what I thought from what I saw online.    And then when you showed me the video, but I wanted to confirm.\n  00:01:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And I was like, is that just a depth of field thing?    Cool.    Yeah.    No, it was really cool.    We're going to have it for Christmas.    It's on our table right now.\n  00:01:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's on our main dining or kitchen table.    I love it.    Thank you for sending me the unboxing.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n  00:01:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      For sure.\n  00:01:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So I got to ask you a question.    The stuff that you sent me, and I just had a chance to look over it briefly.    Um, bangers.\n  00:02:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I did that.\n  00:02:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Absolute bangers.    I'm curious, where did the language come from?\n  00:02:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Me.\n  00:02:09 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What did you...    There's a massive evolution in the language system.    I'm very impressed by it, but I want to know, what were the inputs that gave you that output?\n  00:02:21 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I spent, so I spent probably a day on it, on a weekend, a full Saturday, morning to afternoon.    And I went through, you know how it works with ChatGTP, right?    Like, multiple, multiple, multiple iterations.    And then what I basically did is I was like, I start with framework, and then you go like a step further, list it out, like pagination.    And then I'm like, okay, let's start with slide one.    Give me, give me the, now give me the text.    And I'd be like, no, move it around.\n  00:02:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    But here's the question, though, that I'm wanting to get to, like, I'm assuming...% for me.    So you didn't give it any of our transcripts.    So did you give it though like longevity as the new asset class?    Did you give it this like infrastructure piece?    Did you give it- Oh, you what?\n  00:03:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I think I gave it longevity as the asset class.    I think that's the only thing.    I didn't give it anything else in terms of architecture.    That was already in there way before.    And actually, that might have already been in there because I was thinking of wellness as an asset class.\n  00:03:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's why it rung so true.    Okay.    I started this process like- And what about like the longevity stack?    Is that something that you've had for a while too?\n  00:03:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    The longevity stack was really a critical component for me.    So I went through probably- This is probably- I probably spent altogether five or six- five days on it over a period of time.    Like, I mean, 30 hours, right?    Because I started in one direction, then I kept on refining it.    I had a much longer one in the beginning.    And then I kind of made this one more business centric.    The other one was more of like a like a general hypothesis.    What is longevity?    is longevity?    And then I went online and I had a few other different companies that I like.    And I'm like, these are the modalities I like.    Let's pull those in here.    The biggest trick for me was to figure out how to bucket them, right?    And that's where I spent the most of my time on.    And then refining the language.    That took me the longest time to make sure it resonated.\n  00:04:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I was very impressed.\n  00:04:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay, good.\n  00:04:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, part of what really impressed me was the contrast to, hey, I've got a bunch of like pitch decks for COVID and whatever else that, pardon my French, is more basic , like a little bit more generic language about X, Y, and Z.    And I've got this longevity thesis stuff.    Like you really sent me really well-developed longevity thesis with a lot of foundational language.    I do think we have an opportunity, like I have some thoughts on what, well, not only that, I also have a thought.    There's a little bit of compression for us to do even further.\n  00:05:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      100%.    This was bigger.    Yeah, Oh, I get it.    I'll tell you why it's different.    It's because I'm in full control of longevity.    And with the resort and whatnot, I wasn't trying to get like an ethos or positioning.    I was trying to be more consensus driven on like, what do we have?    I would have taken it a little bit more into the emotional side.\n  00:05:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, and by the way, the emotional side is part of the next cycle we're going to do on this whole longevity thesis.    And it's the missing piece.    And it also is how we then further compress.    And when I say the missing piece, it's the following.    So, like, I'm really genuinely ecstatic about what you sent me and what we can build off of with that.    Gold upon gold.    Gold upon gold.    Gold    It's really clear.    It's coherent.    I've been thinking about this for a year.    Oh, it shows.    It shows, right?    There's a maturity of thought that's baked into this thing.    Now let's talk about the competing narrative.\n  00:06:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    So there's a couple competing narratives that you're up against.\n  00:06:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Number one, you're up against the selling utopia Wellsville.\n  00:06:23 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    Okay.\n  00:06:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, it's like, you know, is this the Truman Show meets Wellsville meets utopia?    Like, like, it's a little, you know, and, or it's, you know, like, it's almost like, hey, are we turning this into a bad sci-fi episode of Black Mirror?    Sure.    So the way that we have to neutralize that, and by the way, another variation of it is like, oh, , is this just like, you know, Brian Johnson meets Bulletproof Coffee for rich people who, you know, who, you know, are having an existential crisis.    Boo-hoo, like, down with the.    Patriarchy.    I don't know.    I'm just, you know.\n  00:07:02 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, no, I get it.    All right.\n  00:07:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, so, so if we, but here, so here's how we inoculate ourself from that is we have to humanize this around the, what people want versus what gets in the way.    Okay.    And, and by the way, things like the new measure of wealth is not lifespan, but health span.\n  00:07:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    That's a big one.\n  00:07:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And like, you know, and, and then the, the ability to like, you talked about a new category of living.    There was more that was in there.    Let me pull it up here.    Yeah.\n  00:07:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's sort of cat.    We're trying to figure out, I was trying to, I didn't really know exactly where to go with this one, but it was trying to figure out for like a business perspective.    Are we creating a new category of, of.    A product, right?    Category creation.\n  00:08:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, so there's a couple ways, I think, and this is part of the merge that you're doing, right?    Which is what we're actually saying is we're building a...    Actually, this would be an interesting thing to actually do further research on.    What real estate development companies have successfully built lifestyle brands?\n  00:08:32 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, that's interesting.    Right?\n  00:08:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because that's the promise of what we're selling.    It's a lifestyle brand.\n  00:08:40 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Equinox.\n  00:08:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But it's tied to...    What's that?    Equinox.    Equinox.    Well...\n  00:08:45 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      They're owned by Related, I think.    What's that?\n  00:08:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think it's owned by Related.\n  00:08:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:08:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So that's an interesting one to take a look at.    Although, are you talking about beyond the gyms and some of their new brand extensions and kind of what they've started building?\n  00:09:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      In the last few years, or?    Well, just in general, so related companies, one of the largest real estate companies in the country, owns Equinox.    And they've actually started to do Equinox.    I don't know if they've actually executed, but they were at one point trying to do Equinox hotels as well.\n  00:09:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly, yes.    They went into hospitality, yep, and okay.\n  00:09:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And there's another one called The Estates.    It's by SBE.    It's a mix of, it hasn't really launched.    It's sort of launched.    I have their deck.    It's SBE and like Tony Robbins and a handful of, and a few other guys as well.    And then I think the other ones in terms of a lifestyle brand, I have to think about that.\n  00:09:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because the, so here's, because here's the thing, what you're, there's a way where you're assembling all the ingredients.    You got all the right ingredients.    Yep.\n  00:09:56 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:09:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And you're even describing, here's some of the rest.    Recipes of how we put these ingredients together.\n  00:10:02 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, sure.    Okay.\n  00:10:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But the question in everyone's mind is, but how does it taste?    Right.\n  00:10:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  00:10:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like what's the actual cake tastes like when it comes out the other side, especially if you're selling community as part of the product or part of this is what the case tastes like.\n  00:10:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So one thing we did before, and I trashed it because I didn't like the way that this third-party company had done it.    They did like the day in the life of, right?\n  00:10:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh-huh.\n  00:10:31 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You know, to a degree.    And it was just so generic.    Playing in the pool with the kids.    this time I'm like, you guys are so far off.\n  00:10:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like this is not.    So here's a consideration for us, which is strategically, we may want to play this where actually what you sell is the promise of the, it's off Okay.    So Let Let know.    In essence, what I'm promising to you is to install this lifestyle and habit.    So we sell the individual experience, the individual workflows, so to speak.    It's the idea, like, take online education.    In the world of education, okay, people come for the content, they stay for the community.    But you don't sell the community first, right?    So unless part of your strategy is, you know, and this is, like, the people at, say, Summit, even though they didn't have the financing side of it well, what they did have really well was they had this influence stack of this network, this audience influence graph.    We already are a community.    So if you are into this community and you want to be plugged into this community, oh, and guess what?    We're plug-and-playing this community into this concept along with a bunch of celebrity tech.    You know, like, you know, icons, blah, blah, blah.    know, Tim Ferriss is getting a place and, you know, Reed Hastings is getting a place, blah, blah.    Oh, and Richard, did you hear Richard Branson got a place, right?\n  00:12:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Like, so they, they created the mystique of the like, well, here's who's in the membership.    Yep.    We're doing that next.    We're doing that next.    It's part of the strategy is to go to sports agents and we've already got some leads and entertainment agents and like, you know, we'll find like an ambassador, give, you know, give them a discount on a villa, all that kind of stuff.    Yes.\n  00:12:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But I would, what I would encourage is go after a few key tech influencers, a few key VC finance influencers.    Okay.    It's about, it's about those centers of power.\n  00:12:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And tapping into their aura, right?    For their group.    You know, that, that makes a lot of sense.    I think, you know, based off what we talked about last time, we're talking about sort of the archetypes of like who.    This is, I think is important, like just pigeonholing it.    And there's another angle to this that I think I come up across a little, I kind of butt heads a little bit with my partner on, where it's like, we may have this like music element to it as well.    So I'm very passionate about the longevity side.    It's longevity has, as you've seen, has a ton of different elements to it.    A lot of it can just be normal sports, right?    If you want to be active, it's active, right?    Movement.    Some of it can be cerebral, can be the education, it can be the spiritual, it can kind of encompass everything.    So it doesn't have to be like, as you said, Brian, John, drinking this freaking snake, snake oil juice, right?    It's like, this is practical stuff.    You want to go to the gym, go to the gym.    You want to go for a swim, go for a swim, whatever, you know, like tennis, we got pickleball.    So, and then there's also like, so that's what we kind of came up with this idea of, and this is not, doesn't have to be, doesn't have to use this, but it's like transformation.    And what do we have in there?    We had transformation and rejuvenation as kind of the elements.    Like I think of this in my    We specifically made the houses smaller and tighter together.    Not from a real estate perspective.    From a perspective, people meet each other and actually stay.    So it stays active.    The one thing that we hated about all the other properties out there is that the places were empty.    So it didn't feel like a community.    felt like a guarded gate community.    Like in LA, you don't know anybody.    You don't know your neighbors.    And that's what we wanted to get away from.    Yes.\n  00:14:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so by the way, put a bookmark on this.    It's not for these decks, but a little bit further down the line.    I think having an initiative called Know Your Neighbors as one of your networking community building activities would be really we're hoping to do like alfresco dinners and like evening fire, you know, drinks by the fire.\n  00:14:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Because what you're solving for with Know Your Neighbors is we create the social lubricant pathways where basically we make...    It's safe for you to connect and get to know, like we reduced the barriers of friction where it's like you get to like networking, connecting with like who really is in this community so you can find your peoples.    You think about it as like curating the community, right?    Curating the social component to it.    That's absolutely part of the DNA.    Right.\n  00:15:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So the.    So I think part of when I kind of like just kind of grok everything that you sent me, I think part of what we have to do is simplify the story.    Yeah.    So and we basically need to layer it.\n  00:15:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Right.\n  00:15:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So that because there's elements to what you're putting forward that for some people is going to be like the scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark when they open the Ark of the Covenant, you know, and like most mere mortals are like, yeah, their faces are.    Melting because they just can't handle it all.    It's too much, right?    So we want to compress it down where there's, to your point, it's more of this choose your own adventure.    And to that end, too, like, I'm going to advocate something and you don't have to agree with me, but I would caution us, I would encourage us to pull back on transformation.    Okay.    Shuri second or third home.    Is there motivation transformation?\n  00:17:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, it's not.    Right?    It almost puts too much hair on this.    It's like, wait.    Whoa, what that mean?    What am I getting into here?\n  00:17:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's like, oh, wait.    Oh, yeah.    This is my wife and her agenda, her hooji-pooji.    She wants me to drink.\n  00:17:13 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's like a choose-your-own-adventure, dip into active lifestyle.    Yeah.    Right?\n  00:17:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So that's what, now, mind you, by the way, can you use this platform for massive multi-level transformation in life?    Of course you can.    You don't have to advertise it like that.    That becomes a more downstream story that comes in year two, year three, about the kinds of outcomes, and habits, and lifestyle, and routines, and what people are getting out of being in.    And that becomes second-order, third-level order effects downstream.\n  00:17:52 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      People don't have to do any of the longevity stuff they want to.    If they don't want to do any of that stuff, what they will do, though, is they will go to the outdoor onset.    They.    They will go to the gym.    They probably will go swimming in the pool and they will play the sports.    Whether or not they dip into like the longevity, you know, pool aid, that's okay.    They don't have to.    But just by being in the environment, being active, moving naturally, there's going to be a natural aura.\n  00:18:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think those who want to get into longevity, it's that you're giving them, you're putting it on the rails.    These are programmatic pathways that are plug and play.\n  00:18:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You don't have to overthink it.\n  00:18:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All you got to do is just show up for your weekend or your week, right?    And then once you show up, and then there's like concierge level service where you get to like, ooh, I want ABC, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.    Let me focus.    These are my intentions for this week.    Boom.    And then like, you know, all this stuff, you know, is basically curated for you.\n  00:18:55 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:18:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, and, um, so yeah.    Yeah, the, um, all right, so let's talk about workflow or process.    How do we, how do we do this next rev cycle?    Orient me, you sent me a few different documents, and I want to understand the relationship between them.    Okay.    Um, because there was, you first sent me like a script or outline, then the operating system.\n  00:19:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I used a script outline to create those, and I had two different versions of those that I created.    They're basically from the same material.\n  00:19:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    What, which is the parent's, what's the North Star document?    Is it the last one, this Cova longevity living that you just sent me another sample draft I'm working on for reference?\n  00:19:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Or I think the first one I sent you was, I think the first one I sent you was more of the reference.\n  00:19:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So the operating system one?\n  00:19:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I think that's right.\n  00:20:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Um, yeah.    Okay.    So this is, I mean, it's basically the same concept.\n  00:20:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      This is slightly different, communicated slightly different on the deck.\n  00:20:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Mm-hmm.    Um, and so here's then the other.\n  00:20:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So the other one's actually not bad.    looking at the other one.    The other one's not bad either.    I know they're both great.    Yeah.    I kind of like that one too.    There's, there's, it's really just, they're kind of the same.    Some of this, a lot of the content is the same.    I might've had one with more updated texts.    I can't remember which one was first to be honest.    Well, here's how, here's what I would say to you.\n  00:20:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The one called longevity living feels a little bit more, uh, consumer facing for lack of better word.    Like it's for the person who's deciding.    It's more resident-facing, the person who's deciding, I want to go join this thing.    The operating system one is a little bit more, you're the investor, the builder, but like, you want to understand the platform that we're setting up underneath this thing.\n  00:21:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So they have slightly different kind of- And there's a reason for that, because one was really made for PR company.    was like, what are you guys doing there?    And the other one was, I started out trying to define this, the product that may also go into our residential buildings in downtown LA.\n  00:21:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Totally.\n  00:21:39 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And so it's really the idea of like, what does that look, what does that, what does longevity mean to relevant growth as a business plan?\n  00:21:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, so, so I love it.    So here's then, again, back to our competing narrative, which is we're selling Utopia or Wellsville.    Like, this all sounds great, but you know, is this Howard Hughes or something, you know, is this 20-    21st century Howard Hughes.    So one of the things that I want to encourage you to solve for ASAP with these longevity products is what are the unit economics on each of those different longevity products?    It's like, oh, if I'm coming into the biohacker lab and I've got the blood labs and I've got the functional medicine doc and I've got the peptides, blah, blah, blah.    Like, how do I know that you actually have a money model there that's a sustainable business model?    You can deliver that product without going bankrupt.    Oh, well, here's the beauty of it.\n  00:22:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It doesn't matter.    Because for us, it's an amenity for the property.    So if it breaks even, we're fine.\n  00:22:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But my point is you need to fill that communication vacuum, right?    Because like to an investor or someone else, if they're valuing...    They kind of want to know, they're like, wait, so how are going to make this thing sustainable?    And so it's like, hey, we have third-party value-added partners with value-added services.\n  00:23:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      that.    We have a third party.    They're doing all the – we haven't engaged them for the financial pro formas yet because I've been trying to figure out what type of operating partner.    Do we do it ourselves?    Do we white-label it with someone else?    Do we bring in a brand?\n  00:23:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I haven't figured that out yet.\n  00:23:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And so the idea was – Even if you have one slide, right?\n  00:23:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Even if we have – if you have one slide with – that basically stakes out the way that you are going to – that you're basically looking at programmatically how you basically build the provider network and how it's financed.\n  00:23:55 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So did you see that – have one model in here in the – it's in the longevity –    Which one's that?    The longevity?    or OS?    It's in the, what's it called?    This one's called the, I won't even show here on this one.    I think it's the longevity operating system.\n  00:24:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:24:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And on one of the pages.    What slide?    It's 11.    It's the resilient model of multiple value drivers, right?    Differentiate product and pricing power, faster absorption, stronger buyer conviction, increases long-term desirability and product value, reoccurring operating revenue.    So medical diagnostics, performance training, membership, membership.\n  00:24:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so this, this is, I remember that slide meaningfully.    I think it's great.    There, it's at, it's at an abstraction layer here.    You need the next level of click down.\n  00:24:46 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    And what is your purpose?    So let's get, I guess I want to get clear.    Like, so that's for the purpose of having a business plan, right?\n  00:24:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's more than that.    Oh, it is.    what I'm wanting to, part of what I'm wanting to.    address right now is it goes back to like, you're selling utopia.    The biggest thing we're up against is disbelief.    Too good to be true.    How is this thing going to work?    Wait, you're building the Rolls Royce of longevity real estate.    Who can afford this thing?    Can you even run this thing without going bankrupt?    Are you going to really like, you know, is this the next fire festival of residential real estate?    Like, there's a bit of the like, we're selling such a big dream.\n  00:25:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, like, it's so like, wait, what?\n  00:25:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So we want we need to basically ground this down.    That's why I want to simplify it.    There's some of these things that's like, need a hole behind behind the curtain, where it's like, we parse it out over time.    We, there's a way where, and by the way, I just want you to know, I am a true believer in this entire  stack.    And to end, we're going to run the table with this thing.\n  00:25:56 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, right.\n  00:25:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I know that to be true.    And I know the kind of operate.    know Thank    I know we're going to do this, but what we have to see, part of it is there are elements here where you're selling chapter 26, you're selling chapter 44, and a lot of people are still back in chapter one or chapter three.    It's like we've got to pace them along.\n  00:26:16 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Would this work, Michael, something like this?    I think that we can get an increase in our rental by 5% or 10%.    Really simple, right?    And I can quantify, I have third-party numbers for all that, for all the numbers.    So there's a bump in that.    That would be from the longevity driver.    I've also got membership, which we're going to sell, right?    And I think we can do, I mean, we've talked all over, but these memberships are anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 a year.    And so we think people that want to come access this, plus other things, we can probably sell 1,000 of those a year.    We can dedicate a portion of the home sales to that by saying that this is like their, we're going to include their upfront membership.    of like 30 grand in there.    Boom, that's done.    And then those little things like that I can do to sort of show people like how this works from a monetization.\n  00:27:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      basically what's the money model that dollarizes each of these different product service value changes.\n  00:27:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And also I think there's these weekend retreats.    Like we get the guru from like the yoga guru that brings 100 people over and books our rooms, right?    Like we're giving them the space for it.    They're going to charge an extra 500 bucks or a thousand bucks for a weekend.    And then we get all the bookings from that.    So it'll help our ADR as well.    So I can quantify all those.\n  00:27:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    So the, I love what you're doing there.    And so this is kind of, if we like skip ahead a little bit in this process, part of what I'm wanting to make sure that we're solving.    for is at the investment committee level.    And obviously, we're not dealing with, you already have your institutional.\n  00:28:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      My business partner asked the same question the other day.    So this is good.    No, I get it.\n  00:28:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So like really smart investment committee level.    And remember, your customers are high net worth individuals who bring that kind of mindset.    So even if they're maybe making an individual investment or their family office is investing and like, yeah, great, let's go in as a real estate holding whatever else.    Really sophisticated investor, the way they're thinking about this is, what are the seven or 10 things I need to believe to be true in order for me to have conviction on making this investment?\n  00:28:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay, now, so you're saying that's the case of that's not just longevity then.    That's also because we have like full third party reports on.    Every other, we just did our pro forma, pretty solid.    But we have, this is like, this model is not new in terms of like the resort model.    So we have all the occupancy rates standardized and ADRs, all that's done.    So I can put together what I think are some of the unit economics for the property in general.    I just went through that exercise on the pro forma, but then I'll pull out some of the, actually, so it depends on what you're trying to pitch here.    we trying to, I have the, I have all the metrics already for the pro forma.    So like, how do we get to that?    How do we get to the sales value?    Like what's our ADR?    Like, how do we get, how do we make money in general from a business perspective?    What I don't have is necessarily how the longevity side directly impacts that.    have a, I have third party for everything else.\n  00:29:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Got it.    So yes.    So yes to everything that you just said.    And we then need to also tell the money model.    We have to build that money model narrative for the individual buyer.\n  00:30:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    I'm working on that.    That I'm working on a two-part item.    Like, what's your break-even if you use it and if you don't use it?    Exactly.\n  00:30:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because think about it this way.    Imagine the family dinner table conversation.    And what they're talking about is like, hey, honey, what do you think about this thing?    It's kind of like the new country club.    Well, hold on.    What's our membership free up front?    Well, what's it going to cost on an annual basis?    Okay, well, what does the menu look like?    What does it cost each time we eat there?    Oh, are there green fees?    Like, each time we play golf, it's like people want to know, they're like, what are we in all in?    we're...    What are the underlying assumptions?    And if we can give them the narrative that breaks all of that down, because you know there's going to be either the husband or the wife that's going to be like, oh, this is the bright, shiny new toy.    Like, honey, there's this thing.    I want this thing.    I want this thing.    And then there's the other partner that's going to be like, yes, sweetheart, I know you're really excited about this thing, but hold on.    Like, I just want to understand, what are we talking about here?\n  00:31:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      What's this commitment?\n  00:31:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      How does it really work?    Like, there's going to be one person who's the, like, passion junkie, and there's one person who's going to be kicking the tires.    And if we can serve up the narrative for basically the buying committee, multi-threaded sales process, where it's like, where we give them the things we're like, where basically the champion has the story that's transportable that they can share with the people they need to get buy-in from, whether that's their spouse, whether that's their investment manager, whether that's who whoever are the other.\n  00:32:01 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So Michael, there's a few elements here.    I think this is what you're driving at.    And I can break this.    I'm thinking about breaking it up into different slides.    So one would be tailored at the individual investor.    One would be sort of just the general overall business model to make sure it makes sense.    From the investor perspective, we have like the short-term rental rights, which do not exist in the Valley, right?    So we have a captured audience.    That's one.    And also our short-term rental model is not only is it highly coveted and with a low supply, supply and demand, economics are in our favor.    The product is better because from a rental, if a renter goes into another project, they can't use the facilities because that is only so there's that.    And then there's also that breakeven component.    So the biggest rub for these owners in the market is I own this house.    I use it six days.    I use it six weeks a year and I'm paying 10, 15 grand a month for it.\n  00:32:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like what?    That doesn't make any sense.    Correct.    And so how do you, so here's, here's the North Star on this process.    What we're communicating to people in each of these different financial narratives is how you de-risk investments.\n  00:33:14 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    Yep.    Okay.\n  00:33:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      By showing them like all of the, like all the multiple outs.\n  00:33:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.\n  00:33:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      These are all the things that is reducing risk that makes this a difficult, if not impossible thing to reject.\n  00:33:29 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We have, we, we do this all the time.    This is like our number one, this is how we, this is exactly how we talk when we talk to investors and our intern our team.    So that's no problem.    I actually have a lot of that written down.    So I just, part of this is trying to figure out and the challenge is sort of what's that North Star narrative.    I think we're actually okay in the weeds when we start talking about the benefits and things like that.    It's how do we communicate, how do we communicate that?    And then what does that, what's, how do we communicate this?    One of the scary things is that we have this PR company that's going to start.    That's going to start going for us.    And we have a company that's building a landing page and all that kind of stuff.    We don't have a narrative for them other than it's got all these cool bells and whistles.    And so that's my biggest concern.    But to your point, I can put this together really fast.\n  00:34:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    So that's going to be the key undercarriage because ultimately, remember that your special sauce, your mojo, and the thing that is going to lift this, basically, that lifts the ceiling on the growth curve of everything that relevantpartners is building, beyond even just Cova, is like we nail this money model narrative through these different, like think of almost like different scenes, right?    These kind of different apertures.    That is the platform for, that is the platform for Infinite Capital.\n  00:35:02 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Got it.    Oh, I can't wait to see this, this, this, uh, syndicator model.\n  00:35:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    Um, because yeah.\n  00:35:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    Got it.    I mean, this is great too, because we are trying to break this down into the nuts and bolts of the business model so that we can then a, we're happy we have visibility, but B we can also duplicate it.    Like what is that secret sauce?\n  00:35:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Um, great.    The, okay.    So that's, um, so that's why I like I'm indexing there first, because again, I want to address this too good to be true.    That's the thing that can clip you down at the knees where it's like, Whoa, Whoa, hold on a second.    This is too big.    It's too much.    Okay.    So we're going to both, we're going to both parse it down into like spoonfuls of sugar so that people.    Don't, you know, get like an insulin spike and, you know, and, and, you know, and, and redline.    And then two is, we're going to keep hitting them with the like, , that makes sense.    Damn that smart.    , I love that arbitrage.    That's really smart leverage.    Okay, like, we're gonna, we're gonna, like, we're gonna, we're gonna channel like really balls out like the financier mindset.    And we're going to make each person who is investing at any of those levels, feel like a world class  financier.\n  00:36:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You want to hear the best part about this business plan?    I'm tell people this, it's like, so hotels make the most money of any asset class, like in terms of the and that's why they're higher on the risk scale in general.    The problem with hotels is that you have all the operating costs.    The beauty of this model is that we get the homeowners pay all the operating costs.    So we get the full income revenue with none of the liabilities and none of the operating costs.    So it's like a hotel with no cost.    It's pure profit.    How does this compare to like Four Seasons residential condos?\n  00:37:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That metaphor.\n  00:37:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Same concept.    Yeah.    Same kind of concept.    They would sell those units.    People would pay management fees and then they would rent them out.    So Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, the Montage, they all do this.    Amon makes almost all of their money on this product.    They make almost no money.    Actually, their hotels always go bankrupt.    They make all their money on their villa sales.    On the luxury residential villa sales.    All of it.    All of it.    Everything else.\n  00:37:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So by the way, that I think potentially needs to be a standalone slide.    Because you just named for me, what's the comparable?\n  00:37:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Is understand the highest, the most successful or highest profitable asset classes is hospitality.\n  00:37:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But here's where hospitality can get caught sort of over the.    And the most high profit, high margin part of luxury hospitality is these residential spinoffs.\n  00:38:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:38:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And where we basically, we're unlocking that with this whole new value-added services beyond just luxury hospitality.    That's this whole longevity thesis.\n  00:38:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We're like the luxury hospitality plus, plus, plus.    Correct.    It's more relevant to today's market.\n  00:38:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Basically, we're luxury hospitality with a different, with a, with a unique differentiation.\n  00:38:32 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.\n  00:38:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:38:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    That's easy to, that's, so, I mean, you're just talking about the framing method to help people understand what we're talking about.    So I get, yeah.    Right.    So that's, so that's, and this is where, again, like you, you grok this, you get it.\n  00:38:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You've got this stuff at your fingertips.\n  00:38:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I'm just kind of giving you a few key vectors.\n  00:38:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We just kind of need to recombinate a few things.    Now let's, let's move upstream or move up to the.    The move up to the, let's move up to the narrative and the narrative as it relates to basically the arc that we need to carry people through depending on who the person is.    Because depending on which of these, for lack of a better word, depending on which actor or character they are, like whether they're a villa owner or rather a villa buyer, whether they are a syndicate investor or whether they are like an institutional investor, we kind of have these different pathways of what people are coming in on.    And then, by the way, even within those pathways, then there's going to be, there's going to be a few potential like personas or archetypes within those two.    Okay.    But the, so.    What we then have to do is we kind of need to engineer the, like, what's the opening scene?    Like, where does the story begin?    Okay.    That's like, that's the hook in the trailer that makes me go, ooh, oh yeah, I want to watch this show on Netflix.\n  00:40:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I want to go see this movie.\n  00:40:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then we're taking them beat by beat through these decision gates where they just, each decision gate, they're like, go on.    Oh, but wait, there's more.\n  00:40:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  00:40:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And we're like, we're taking them beat by beat through this and with a really clear, like, oh, great.    And here's the call to, oh, here's what I can do next if I want to be a part of this.    Ooh.    And there's a little bit of FOMO or some kind of little urgency and scarcity that motivates me to actually, that incentivizes me to make a choice or take an action now.\n  00:40:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, the scarcity is easy.    So, okay, I got it.    So, so essentially just identifying what those, what those individual decision gates or.    Yeah.    We're high-level kind of risk mitigation conversations that we're going to have, right?    Where it's like, it's too expensive.    This product is not new.    It already exists.    Here, you know, we're just a better version of it.    Why the real estate model is great.    We're hotel developers.    Here's the problem with that, right?    Here's why this is better.    And then kind of go through that model just to kind of sell the model, basically.\n  00:41:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And here's what's key is we have to build some cognitive discipline in which version or pathway are we in right now.\n  00:41:36 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:41:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because otherwise we have context collapse, right?    Because look, selling this little hospitality thesis, like hospitality industry thesis, to the villa owner, there's going to be a different version of that than the hospitality thesis to your institutional investment.    Okay.    Fair.    Okay.    So this is what I'm getting.    This is where we have to really know who's the hero or the character, initiate sequence, this is the journey they're going on from a narrative set of beats.\n  00:42:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No problem.    I do that all the time.    So we can do an investor narrative, in a sense, for different groups.    For example, I think what we're trying to figure out right now is the narrative for the actual villa buyer, because that's where we're going to market.    Yep.\n  00:42:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So it's kind of the brand.\n  00:42:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And then on the narrative for the investor, I think that's something that we have.    So I have two decks, right?    I've got our pitch deck for the investment.    I have a pitch deck for the villa.\n  00:42:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So here's what I want.    Here's what you can help me with is give me the quick and dirty version for each of those.\n  00:42:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, easy.    can hold on.\n  00:42:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Here's what I want to zero in on.\n  00:42:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:43:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      want to zero in on is the assumptions layers.    So what are the, so for instance, so basically take like a villa owner.    We have a thesis.    This is the thesis we have for the villa owner.    And of this thesis, we actually have three different potential hooks or pathways that we are going to further test and validate to identify our basically narrative market fit.    Which of these is the highest performing motivation or driver?    Okay.    Because one driver might be the, hey, I'm just, I'm finally, I'm just looking to make my like luxury home residential like investments.    Another one is, dude, I'm hardcore into longevity.    The other one is existential crisis.    And man, I know I need to be living a better life.    And these are super, super generic primitives that I'm giving.\n  00:43:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I get it.    Right.\n  00:44:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But we want to think about, okay, if this is the starting point, sort of create these three different pathways where we then decision tree the thing out.    If this is the place you're starting from, this is how we pace the journey of basically the decision gates in people's minds for people to be like, ooh, yeah, this is for me, or this might be for me.    Oh, I belong in this story.    Oh, wait, where is it going?    Oh, yeah, I want to go there.    Oh, wow, I really identify with these emotional desires versus dilemmas.    Ooh, yes, you're giving me the reasons to believe, right?    Because we buy on emotion, but we justify through logic.\n  00:44:40 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, get it.    And you want me to list out just the three for, or I can do more than that.    Yeah, do it in more like bullet point format.    Yeah, no, I will.    I'm just going to, I'm to wireframe this out and then I'll do it for the villa owners as well as the buyer.    I already understand the buyers really well, sorry, the investors really well.    The villa owners, I have a pretty good idea.    We have a great, phenomenal sales guy on board.    He's been doing this forever.    Part of the first three months of villa sales is just this conversation, identifying what are the drivers.    People want big houses, they want little houses.    Are they in here for the social?    they like the architecture?    Do they like the price point?    Are they really in it for short-term rentals?    Or are they really, are they in it for the fractional because they can't afford anything else?    Like what's driving that?\n  00:45:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I think exactly.    to that end, so like, I believe that the luxury second home that also cash flows.\n  00:45:52 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, we could not agree more.    There is a huge, huge plank to this.    Yeah.    And then.\n  00:46:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Then it's like, oh, but wait, you also get to eat your cake.\n  00:46:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Like you get your cake and you eat it too.    Well, it's like, right?    Yeah.    If you look at our pitch deck, that's the pitch.    It's amazing design.    All this wellness and longevity stuff you can get.    But we have this really flexible and interesting ownership model that's for you, right?    Which is short-term rentals as well as co-ownership.    But yes, and we need to, I would advocate we flip it around.    That's totally fine too.\n  00:46:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I mean, we don't have- We can, by the way, we still, look, your thesis is going to be around longevity.\n  00:46:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So it's not like we're holding the thing back as a big I that's the emotional component, right?    There's a differentiation piece up front.\n  00:46:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But I don't think we should sell them on this big, long thing about longevity.    We should actually sell them on the money model of luxury residential that cash flows, and, but we can give them the hook.    can them    up front in the trailer of longevity as an asset class.    So it makes me think, wait, okay, whoa, hey, there's a unique concept here, right?    But we start with the financial value proposition.    And then we give them this long tail of choose your own adventure and how you can get on multiple different rides, depending on where you're at, where you're wanting to get to, and where this fits into your, you know, larger conception of health span as, the greatest expression of life.\n  00:47:31 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      actually like that as the rock, because I think that makes, actually, that makes a lot of sense.    Because if you, if you use it as the foundation, that's not going to change, right?    That's going to be the main driver of the decision on the financial side.    And then what they choose to do in, once they get inside, that's the choose your own adventure.    So it starts with the premise.    I get that.    I like that.    That's a good way.    That's a really great way to position it.    It's like, oh, you might want to go to the music venue and listen to, you know, DJ in the afternoon and have a, .    .    You know, 20 martinis.    I don't know.    But, you know, we have these different adventures with different people, kids, grandparents.\n  00:48:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, I get it.    It makes sense.    Right.    Because otherwise we're, yeah, so what we need to do is what we're actually selling up front.    It's actually not just, it's that, it's not just that actually.\n  00:48:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      If I was, if I'm going to come back to the rocks, I would say that it's the, it's the, that money model, if want to call it that.    And then it's also, it's also, there's an element of like the experience, the getaway experience that people are driving for.    And that's ubiquitous in a sense, right?    It's like, I'm getting away.    kind of stepping out.    I think at least like, yeah.\n  00:48:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, so here's, here would then be the way I would explore that space.    It's the, the general idea.    It's the place or the destination you'll never get sick of.\n  00:48:57 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You'll never be bored with.    Oh, I like that.\n  00:49:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because that's the fear when you go into fractional, when you go into, oh , what's the, I'm having an old brain fart.\n  00:49:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Short-term rental.    Well, not even that, know.    Timeshare.    Exactly, timeshares, blah, blah, blah, right?\n  00:49:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's like, oh, but are we going to really want to keep going back to that place?    And we're going to get locked into that place.\n  00:49:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We're going to keep being reinventing and refreshing.\n  00:49:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh-huh.    Yeah.    Right, and so, so that's what, that, again, we're addressing one of the exits out of the story.    Oh, do we really want to commit?    Don't we like visiting lots of different destinations and going to Europe one year and we go to Africa the next and we do this and that?    It's like, no, this is, this is a different part.    This, this is not the travel adventure trip.    This is actually embedding this as a lifestyle decision where you get to then right size it to your life.    Whether you're here once a month.    You're    Once a quarter, you come here for, you know, residential for a season, like you can kind of like you work it, you're able to, it's like a building block that you can program into your life.\n  00:50:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So Michael, this is something that I've been, I've been struggling with.    And I pushed back on my team a little bit on this because I didn't want to be the jack of all trades and be like, what kind of watch do you want?    But if we reframe it to a position of it's the place you never get sick of in a sense, right?    You're always, because we're always reinventing and always refreshing ourselves.    you know, we're kind of staying ahead of it.    Then it's like, you're going to come back because we've got, we're always going to have different events where we have music, you know, we have access to music festivals down the street that never gets old.    It's a lifestyle component.    There's a community aspect to it.    There's a longevity.    Like there's all these elements that you can dip into.    And there's all these, these like curated, like professionals that are coming in here for these retreats.    Yes.    So it's not, and you know, something that really actually resonates in a sense.    That we're trying to build something.    If I think in my head of what this place is, it's very active.\n  00:51:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Right?\n  00:51:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So here's another phrase we may be scaffolded with.    Dynamic destination.    Okay.    Yeah.\n  00:51:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because remember too, there's a potential fear of the like, all right, we're going to get a place in the desert.    Isn't that going to be really kind of quiet?    Okay, great.    It's relaxing, but isn't it quiet and boring and stayed?    Dynamic destination.    Yeah.\n  00:51:32 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:51:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.\n  00:51:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And that could be a tagline for us.    Dynamic destinations.    Something like that.    That's actually better than the transformation.\n  00:51:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Right.    Because again, not everyone's ready.    No one's looking on their bingo card.    You know, I'm looking to buy transformational real estate.    It's not the motivational dryer.    It's dynamic.\n  00:52:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Uh-huh.\n  00:52:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Dynamic destination.\n  00:52:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's definitely, yeah.\n  00:52:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And so, yeah, so we have the, because remember, by the way, too, the challenge for high net worth individuals is, right, there's more dry power than people know where to put it.    The challenge is capital allocation.\n  00:52:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Sure.\n  00:52:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      don't know where to put my money.    I'm looking for interesting things that have a good IIR, I'm sorry, IRR, and are going to cash flow.\n  00:52:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:52:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And become this great story that I become a part of and that I also can then share.    And by the way, here's the other key component that I might also consider building in.    The way that they can share.\n  00:52:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    This thing with their friends.\n  00:52:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So that they become a nexus point.    For.    Right.    Like the, their community for their influence graph.    Like imagine, imagine if you have, you know, an ownership or fractional ownership and just like, you know, friend might be like, oh, you know, you can use our condo, you know, over and over in Ojai anytime you want.    But instead they're like, oh yeah, no.    You know, it's kind of like, oh, you know, we have season tickets to the Lakers.\n  00:53:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Just let me know.    I always think of it like the cool kids, right?    You want to hang out with you.    It's like, hey, I have some really good friends of mine that do this in Asia.    They have houses in Niseko and Thailand.    And I swear they've made all their money just giving their houses away to the wealthiest of the wealthy.    And there's an influence peddling element to that as well.    It's like, hey, it's great for your family.    It's great for your lifestyle.    It's great for your health.    It's also great for your relationships if you want to give this away.    Yeah.    And by the way, so that's the kind of slide that I want.    Yeah.    Right.\n  00:53:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like you're showing them all these different vectors of value creation.    It's great for it's great for your friend.    Emily, it's great for your health.    It's great for your influence.    It's great for your friend.    It's great for your network.\n  00:54:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I'm writing it down right now.    It's like, oh, , look at this platform of optionality for me.    Yeah, yeah.    Because that's investors think.\n  00:54:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    I've got all of these different vectors of unlocking value creation, and it stacks, and it compounds.    This is how I tend to think when I do pitch decks for investors, right?\n  00:54:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's always like, what is the business model for the developer, and then why does it sell to the retail investor, right?\n  00:54:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:54:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And the investor also wants to know what the retail investor's motivation is.    They want to understand the business model, but the retail investor doesn't really care.    doesn't necessarily need to know about the business model.    They just want to know what's in for me, and how does it work for me financially, right?\n  00:54:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Yeah, okay.\n  00:54:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I get it.    Yeah, do that.    No problem.    No problem.    That's helpful.\n  00:54:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I think, again, because...    Because this whole business is a money model business for everybody involved, including the villa owner, the villa buyers.    We have, like, that is a, that is the, like, the meat and potatoes of this thing that we need to, like, break down in a way that, like, is really clear, is simple to understand, is high trustworthy.\n  00:55:23 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:55:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That we show how we de-risk for people, and it has all the levels of click down for those who want or need it as supplementals and blah, blah, blah, or the, okay, great, I see all your assumptive layers, and these are all reasonable, conservative, assumptive layers, back to, like, what are all the things I need to believe are true in order for me to have conviction in making this investment?    And, or, how do I know that I'm not going to be sort of, you know, like, up a creek without a paddle on this investment?    Yeah.\n  00:55:52 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep, I get it.    It makes sense.    I mean, part of this as well, for the investors, we are bringing on, like, a co-developer that's really.    Are we thinking to really just those two classes, right?    The buyer and the investor, right?    Essentially.    Yes.\n  00:57:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then, but then feel free.    So I would first do, I would do level one, buyer and investor.    And then if you have the bandwidth or desire, I would name the, like for instance, on the buyer front, three personas or archetypes.\n  00:57:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:57:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And on the investor front, I might then make differentiation of the different pools of capital that represent at different stages, right?\n  00:57:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Your institutional folks versus the syndicates or whatever else.    here's the beautiful thing.\n  00:57:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      If you just name a few of the motivations and drivers for each of those sub audiences, AI will then go model it out for you.\n  00:57:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I'm a planner.    And so this is bread and butter stuff for me.    This is easy.    Yeah, no worries.    Yeah, no, this is how I think.    So that's something I can, so.    Two different buckets, and then three archetypes underneath those, and five to seven underneath those.\n  00:58:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, the key questions we need to answer, exactly.    And then, in addition to those five to seven key questions, anything else that you want to write around motivational drivers?\n  00:58:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.\n  00:58:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, what matters to them?    What they really care about?\n  00:58:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Anything like their health, or their family, or their image, right?\n  00:58:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, here's another category, too.    For each of those audiences and the sub-personas, what are they most afraid of?\n  00:58:43 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Ah, fear.\n  00:58:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This goes back to de-risking.    What do we need to de-risk?    And or, how do we speak to desire versus dilemma, the existential parts of fear?    other Thank    In a way that's not inadequacy marketing, we're not going to prey on their fears and vulnerabilities, but we're going to actually show compassion.    We're going to show luxury hospitality doesn't sell and prey on your fears.    This luxury hospitality engages with you at the most dignified level of seeing your highest self and being a platform for the expression of your highest self and the most cultivated, the most curated, the most essential, elegant, aesthetic form.\n  00:59:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I get that.    Okay, that's great.    That's a nice little archetype I can pull out there.    I think that I can do that easily.\n  00:59:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    And let me ask you then, do you want to, because I want to make sure we're cranking on this.\n  00:59:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Do you have time?\n  00:59:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Do you want to wedge in another session next week before the holiday break?    Because if you give me that output, what I can also do is I can then start scaffolding off of that, and we can do the next turn off of the decks, where we now start to compress it down, and we start actually building narrative architectures for each of those pathways.    I can get that done.\n  01:00:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I could do Monday or Tuesday.\n  01:00:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's look up Monday.    What's the latest you could do on Monday?\n  01:00:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Three or four.    All right, let's do four o'clock.    Okay.    Cool.\n  01:00:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Rando question.\n  01:00:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yes.\n  01:00:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What is, tell me about the name Relevant Partners.\n  01:00:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      What does that mean?\n  01:00:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Where did that come from?\n  01:00:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, so, I mean, so Relevant Group was my business partner's first business.    I was there when he created it, and it was really just looking for a name, and that kind of popped.    Yeah.    Yeah.    I think it was just kind of a discovery series.    Like, oh, that sounds cool.    Now, we haven't really played on this.    There's so much we could do with it.    And then now we're no longer, that relevant group was being wound down.    And then the idea behind this one was Grant and I as partners, right?    Relevant, doing things that are, and the idea, we loved it because the idea was we're doing things that actually matter, right?    That are not like anything but cookie cutter, things that really resonate with people.    And I mean, obviously, there's a whole bunch of, like, be relevant.    We've had this whole thing about playing on that.    should never have.\n  01:01:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    So we don't have to make a decision on it right now at all.    Names are sacred.    Name changes should never be taken lightly.    I just want to point out that you are so strong on this longevity thesis.\n  01:01:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    And I believe that this is going to be the point of differentiation for everything that you build.\n  01:01:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That we either need to find a way to.    to layer in so that relevant, so that the name of the firm matches.\n  01:02:05 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We were thinking relevant longevity or relevant wellness or be relevant.\n  01:02:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Or is that not, does that not work?\n  01:02:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      But it doesn't have to, we're not sold on that.    It was just sort of like, oh, it was an easy, it was an easy play, right?    Yeah.\n  01:02:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Just a couple of riffs, spaghetti against the wall.    ahead.\n  01:02:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Are you, go ahead.    Now I was thinking, are you thinking of a new brand for relevant, the company or a new brand or a brand for the actual longevity component?    Okay.    Just, okay.    Just, I'll put to you this way.\n  01:02:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So there, there, there's a great, there's a great heuristic around this, which is, are you a house of brands or a branded house?\n  01:02:57 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    Yeah, sure.\n  01:02:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Right.    So House of Brands is like Procter & Gamble, House of Brands.    Yes, I get it.\n  01:03:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We got Tide, we got Mr.\n  01:03:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Clean, so on and so on.    A branded house is Virgin.\n  01:03:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      LVMH.    Well, no.\n  01:03:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because LVMH then has a whole bunch of House of Brands.\n  01:03:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Hermes or whatever.    There you go, right?\n  01:03:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We're a branded house.\n  01:03:21 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Or like Virgin.\n  01:03:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Talk about branded house.    We got Virgin Cola, we got Virgin Airlines, we got Virgin Mobile, blah, blah, blah.    So there's no right or wrong, but it has implications for, again, brand, platform, and ecosystem, and the way in which you think of IP, and how that gets then deployed.    And so just, you know, the name relevant partners right now is a little bit like, you know, like the tail on the caboose right now to where this thing is going.    Yeah, I agree.    um, now, uh...    But it's in the wild.    You know, and I think then the question becomes, so there's a few different pieces to this.    One is, like, here's some of the optionality decision trees.    One thing is you take the name partners off because it's just noise.\n  01:04:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I was thinking about a single word.\n  01:04:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So even just being called relevant as opposed to relevant partners, it's a little more essential.    Yeah.\n  01:04:23 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So that's one path in the short term.\n  01:04:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Another path is a slight variation as opposed to relevant, relevance.    Um, relevance is a little bit more lyrical.\n  01:04:41 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Interesting.\n  01:04:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      There's a, there's a sense of relevant.    So relevant has a sense of, it's a statement.    Relevance has a sense of something unfolding.\n  01:04:57 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's very interesting.    Right?\n  01:05:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      There's something about it ontologically.    Relevant, as like an evaluative statement, relevance is this thing that's like, you keep feeding it, you keep cultivating it.    A little softer.    Relevant is more historical.    Looking backwards, relevance is more active.    Okay?    So that's just another riff.    Something else would then be, you know, completely going blue sky.    And is there a different holding company name even beyond relevant partners, relevant or relevance?    But I don't know.    I just wanted to just open that up for you, because we're doing some really thoughtful stuff on this narrative architecture of beyond Kova, but really thinking about this longevity thesis.    And I think the longevity thesis could be really well served by a very iconic.    and symbolic name at the holding company level.\n  01:06:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Interesting.    Right?\n  01:06:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because you're, because, right, Cova is just the beginning.    Cova is just the proof of concept demonstration to something that you want to do at a much greater scale, whether it's continuing to literally replicate Cova in multiple other, you know, like turn that into a franchise and or do other integrations where we take the core infrastructure of what you're doing, but then it shows up in other concept expressions.    Is that a correct assumption?\n  01:06:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, that's right.    Yeah.\n  01:06:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    So, so yeah, but we don't need to figure it right now.    I'm just wanting to plant some seeds.\n  01:06:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, that's interesting.    I mean, essentially, then we could have a holding company with Cova and relevant partners underneath it.\n  01:06:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That too.    That too.    I mean, it could be that, yeah, the relevant partners is just within the holding company that plays a certain functional.    A certain, a certain, you know, functional fiduciary sort of, you know, role.    And yeah, the, by the way, relevance versus relevant, relevance also has a little bit more sense of refinement, a little bit more luxury.    For sure.\n  01:07:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Right.\n  01:07:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Relevance.    Like it almost sounds, it's like, it's more, it's strong.\n  01:07:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's like the company.    We're relevant.    Right.    I mean, it's, it's a statement.    It's an exclamation point for sure.    Right.    It's a little cocky in a sense.    Yeah.    Right.\n  01:07:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    And relevance is.\n  01:07:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We're kind of creating.    Well, here, here would be the, so here's the difference and forgive, forgive if I'm, if I'm, if I'm overshooting on the metaphor.\n  01:07:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Relevance is new money.    Relevance is old money.\n  01:08:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Interesting.    Okay.    Do you see the association there?\n  01:08:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I get it.\n  01:08:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I get it.\n  01:08:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Relevance is a little more classical.    Relevance is a little bit more lyrical.    Relevance is trying a little less hard.    Relevance is exclamation point.    We got something to prove.\n  01:08:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I totally get it.    Yeah, I get it.    Yeah, we definitely have something to prove with that.    Relevance is something like we're...    No, it's a lot more refined.\n  01:08:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh-huh.    I like it.\n  01:08:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Interesting.    Let me chew on that.\n  01:08:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Just, I don't know, just something...    And, you know, if you want to be really snooty about it, you can be like, no, no, no, we're called Relevance.    It's Relevance.\n  01:08:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I don't think we can do that.    I'm taking the piss.\n  01:08:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm taking the piss.\n  01:08:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, I get it.    I get it.    I get it.    And let's just put a little accent above the A.    right.    Relevance.    Okay, cool.    Interesting.\n  01:09:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's something you want.\n  01:09:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      This is helpful.    So I'm going to go ahead, you're going to send me these notes, and then I'm going to take that, I'm going to build out the architecture as we discussed, and then I'll get that to you soon.    Yeah, and we'll do a cycle on this before the holidays.\n  01:09:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You're cooking right now, by the way.    I'm so excited and impressed, because the way to unlock the power of AI is the stronger the ontology.    So the beauty of what you've already produced is there's a lot of ontology there.    Ontology is the order of things.    It's click down, it's detail, it's the language system.    So it's like, boom, it's so clear, it's so specific, it's so layered.    Now, and then we're going to strengthen the, basically, we're going to strengthen the upfront, like, these are the lenses of analysis that we care about, or this is like, these are the jobs to be done.    At the high level, that we can then run through for the inference layer to do its analysis, especially using my storied AI model, where we can then really high signal, like, boom, like, hit, like, knock it for each of those different audiences and sub archetypes.\n  01:10:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Totally get it.    I mean, this is very much the chat CTP process, right, of refinement, right?    And I spent a lot of time on it.    mean, it's such a great tool if you want to get things out fast and iterate and iterate and iterate and iterate.    Right.    So it just takes time, but it's, it's so helpful.    So I can, I can get this crank in.    Awesome, my friend.    Thank you for your time.\n  01:10:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You're like, my pleasure.    We'll speak next week and holler if any thoughts, questions before then.\n  01:10:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay, done.    Thanks, buddy.    Cheers.    And more, more, more photos and videos of chocolate.    I will give you more.    I'll give you some when we're eating.    Okay, buddy.    Cheers.    Bye.    Bye.\n",

Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

            "systemMessage": "=You are a helpful assistant and an expert in communications. \n\n# **ROLE AND PURPOSE**\n\nYou are a specialized assistant designed to help users at Storied craft high-performing emails, especially sales call follow-ups, in a way that aligns with the company's narrative-driven methodology and per Storied's 3-part sales process.\n\nYou are required to draft concise, action-oriented follow-up emails for sales and advisory sessions. Your writing style reflects the guidelines from Michael’s guidelines and swipe files documents, especially for sales meetings and client session follow-ups, emphasizing direct language, clear next steps, and a professional yet approachable tone. Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently. OR “Appreciated our conversation on \\[specific day of the week”\\]  \n\\[Option 1: \"Appreciated learning more about \\[specific topic or goal discussed\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 2: Loved hearing about your work and vision on \\[initiative they’re working on.\\]  \n\\[Option 3: \"Excited about the progress you're making on \\[specific project or initiative\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 4: \"Appreciated hearing about \\[key insight or challenge they shared\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 5: “You clarity around \\[an organizational goal\\] is inspiring.”\\]\n\nNext steps:\n• \\[Action item 1 – what I will do and by when\\]. For example: We'll set up a 1-hr deep dive session to discuss needs / desired outcomes\n• \\[Action item 2 – what the recipient needs to do and by when\\].
