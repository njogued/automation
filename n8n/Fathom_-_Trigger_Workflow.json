Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:00 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      I think it's my desk.    I'm trying to raise it, and I think it's cutting out your audio.    How are you?    How was your day with JLO?\n  00:00:09 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It was great.    I had a lot of fun.    Great group of folks.    Are you deeply involved with the technology group?    I am.\n  00:00:19 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      So my team works across all the different groups.    So a few members of my team were there.    Lee Daniels and Nick Levigny.    I don't know if you met either.    of them.\n  00:00:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Yeah, of course.\n  00:00:33 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, both of them.\n  00:00:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Absolutely.\n  00:00:35 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      yeah, yeah.    So they're both in our consulting org, and we work across all the clients.    So we have people tied into all of them.    But I personally have not been to our tech forum, but I heard it was really good this year.\n  00:00:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Awesome.    What inspired you to reach out?\n  00:00:55 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      So, I'm trying to remember.    When it was, but at some point when I was at Brightspot, we worked together with Elliot Kielin.    Do you remember Elliot?\n  00:01:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, do you remember Elliot?    Do you remember what the project might have been?    The name Brightspot rings a bell.\n  00:01:16 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, this is what I was trying to remember too, Michael.    Because we definitely, it was back then, and I do think you already had started Storied.    So it's possible we brought you in for client engagement or for an internal meeting.    I think, no, I never contracted directly with Brightspot on anything.\n  00:01:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think that we shared a client, and there was someone you guys were working with that I was working with as well.    And so we were brought in together based on that.    Were you doing a lot of work with Meta back in the day?\n  00:01:52 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Google.\n  00:01:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, I do, I've done a lot of work with Google, but more so as faculty and training, less so.\n  00:02:00 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Consulting.\n  00:02:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But that's why Meta, I was embedded there for seven years, worked across 14 product and organizational divisions.\n  00:02:09 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Oh, cool.    Oh, nice.    I don't know.    Okay, I'll have to ask.    I'll have to ask Elliot.    He'll remember he has a great knack for those things.    But I was, so I was talking to Sanjay, who's our CEO, about your keynote.    And, you know, he was saying great things about, you know, the topic that we were talking on.    And I was trying to remember if we had done any client work together, because it could be really, I kind of want to learn more about where you're at and the kind of work you're doing.    You know, if you still engage with organizations that way.    But I just thought it would be good to connect the dots and see if it made sense to do any partnerships with, I can share a little bit more about what we do in consulting at JLL.    So yeah, just sort of wanted to make that connection.\n  00:02:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Cool.    Love it.    I'm glad you reached out.    Well, tell me actually a little bit about the kind of work that you're doing at JLL.    That'll help contextualize.\n  00:03:06 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, absolutely.    So hopefully you learned a little bit about JLL at that event, but I lead our consulting team, which is basically end-to-end real estate advisory services.    We work across all of the adjacent business lines at JLL, and we act as the advisor to the corporate real estate team.    So we're primarily focused on occupiers, Meta, Google, you know, the likes, and help them with anything from defining the future experience in their built environment.    So design, service delivery, workplace technology.    We do portfolio planning.    So where should they be located?    How much space do they need?    That then feeds into brokerage work.    And then a big part of what we do is we kind of act as...    Management consultancy to the CRE team.    So we help them with big transformation programs, reorgs.    We do M&A projects.    We do a lot of like leadership change and transformation initiatives.    And so we have a big kind of change management communication function that either where our client is the leadership within the organization, or it's the end users who are impacted by the real estate team and what's happening to them.    That's really cool.    Thank you for giving me that wider, deeper context.\n  00:04:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And what across all of that portfolio of work, what are you most excited about these things?\n  00:04:46 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Oh, that's a great question.    So probably similar to everyone else, we are in a big AI adoption transformation.    But what's really exciting for my team is we are positioned, and we've been doing this work with clients, to help them bring AI into all parts of their real estate operations.    And so it's, you know, visioning, road mapping, identifying those big opportunity areas, and then, you know, bringing in all the partners to help with the implementation.    So we have a big technology arm of JLL that does a lot of that.    So it's, I think, you know, we've gone through many waves of real estate and workplace.    The biggest one most recently was, you know, the pandemic and coming out of that.    And I think probably in the next six months, we'll probably won't hear anyone talk about RTO anymore, because they're going to be so busy with figuring out how to create new environments that are enabled by different forms of technology.    So...    So...    For me, like any one of those client scenarios has so many streams that come out of it because of what it means for organizational change, communicating, you know, the new norm, getting people on board, operating that model.    So, yeah, it's that to me is the most exciting, the moment.    Cool.\n  00:06:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It is.    It's exciting, wild times that we're in right now.    Yeah.\n  00:06:30 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah.    So what are you up to with Storied?    Yeah.\n  00:06:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, man, where to start?    So a couple of things.    One is I am doing a lot more work across venture and PE.    And I'm actually in late stage conversations about becoming an operating partner at an early stage VC fund.    Thank Thank    And be a fractional role.    But I'm doing a lot, yeah, just a lot more work with early stage startups.    Involved with, because my work is like investment narratives, category creation, go to market storytelling.    And what's unique and different about what I do and how I do it is, I focus on the narrative architecture.    And so, you know, part of the, and so in addition to the startup stuff, I also have a book of business that is, I work with Salesforce.    I work with Amazon.    I work with LG.    A lot of work in healthcare up and down the value chain.    So working with CEOs and executive teams that are, basically need help with how to turn the strategy into the story and everything that that means.    In terms of business transformation, change management, how do you win in the boardroom, how do you take things that are really complex and technical, and turn them into something that people can see, feel, and believe.\n  00:08:18 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      And what's that?    I said that might be something we could use your help with internally within JLO.    In what ways?\n  00:08:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What are some of the pain points there?\n  00:08:30 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Well, we're working on a big five-year strategy for the global firm, and we're quite good with the strategy development.    We're quite bad with the communication, change management, connecting the dots kind of thing.    And so I actually was with our CEO's chief of staff last week, and we were chatting about just the importance of this kind of rollout.    But we have, we're working with the.    CG on the strategy itself, but, you know, just then the deployment is where it's super important to hit the hearts and minds and also be really clear on, you know, what it means for everyone and our investors, right?    We're a public company and our clients.\n  00:09:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    And I'm curious, tell me about your role in terms of.    I get the sense that you've got this really cool, like special forces sort of mission and mandate of the way that you're working across so many different things.    And what is the arc of that, like over the next three to five years, your own vision or the company's vision in terms of what you're doing and all the dots that you're connecting?\n  00:09:53 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, yeah, no, it's a good point.    I think so.    And real estate has been talking about transformation of our industry for a long time now.    And everyone's been like, since WeWork, everyone was kind of shaking in their boots when WeWork was having its heyday.    And it sort of felt like the industry was going to completely flip on its head and change as far as how we operate.    And then everyone knows what happened with WeWork.    It really changed that trajectory.    And so we've gone through a much more gradual change and evolution.    And it seems like, and I don't have a crystal ball, that it needs to change over the next five years or so, but it will continue to be gradual.    Like it's not going to be like a big kind of Netflix change to an industry type of thing.    But what that means is we were not forced to fully integrate our business lines.    Like we've gone through a lot of different org.    To bring our business lines closer together.    And we are on that path to do more and more of that.    And my team kind of sit across all these.    So it does turn us into a bit of an integrator.    But we need to superpower, supercharge all of that work.    So the best way one of our clients put it to us is like, I don't really want to know about the spaghetti of your organization.    I just want, you know, what comes out of, you know, and the perfect pasta dish.    So I think that's going to be a really exciting and important area for us going forward is stitching together, not just the internal partnerships, but from a client perspective, what does it mean for them no longer have to navigate a 110,000 person company?    That, you know, have lots of different functions.    What percentage of your P&L is external client versus internal client?    That's a good question.    Most is external.    So.    So we do, even if it's internal, it's external dollars being passed through.\n  00:12:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n  00:12:07 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      So the only thing that's, the thing that's internal is, so like really simple example, we do workplace strategy within my team.    JL also has a design team.    We have an interior design group.    So we sell services together, right?    Like completely joined services.    So that's important for internal.    And then the other thing that's important is, we have a massive set of clients that are already JLL clients.    And so we do a lot of our sales in like through our networks internally versus like going to hit the street.    It's just like a, you know, we're not a, we have that kind of enablement.    And what percentage of JLL's revenue mix is like value added services or consulting like you guys are doing?    Oh my God, such a small percent.    We were tiny in the whole thing.    Like how small of a percentage would you say?    Like a rounding error.\n  00:13:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    And so what is it though that, so how do you communicate about the value and the importance of what you guys are doing in that context?\n  00:13:22 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Because we are tip of the spear.    So we can create the new client relationship before they go and establish a new facility management global outsourcing agreement.    That's a big procurement led RFP.    We can go in and build relationships, do small engagements, get things running.    We are the research and thought leadership engine.    So we push out a lot of the contents that you see, like from our firm, just about what's leading practice.    And we're sort of that creative what's next new with helping our clients with strategic work.    But I mean, our business is...    It's massive.    As you can imagine, brokerage is one of our biggest revenue sources.    the dollar revenues that come through consulting are small from a fraction of, like, from a percentage of the full business.\n  00:14:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Have you started to play with, like, ways to dollarize your value or impact on renewals or continuity or deal velocity and those kinds of things?\n  00:14:24 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, it's actually something that is on our, like, planning list for next year.    So with, and you've probably read about it, with AI, the consulting firms are all going through a different kind of review of commercial models.    But we also are looking at outcome-based pricing and how to, especially for the things that we impact, we were very involved in renewal, we're involved in new RFPs, we're involved in transactions.    So how do we tie our value to that, but also go at risk more where we can get bigger upside on the end?    So that's a big kind of area that we're exploring at the moment as to what that looks like for our consulting business.\n  00:15:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well said.\n  00:15:21 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      That's what's going on in my consulting business.\n  00:15:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    This is why I'm working in venture and PE, right, is that I'm actually getting staked with equity in, like, a lot of the work that I'm doing so that I'm actually properly dollarizing the true impact of, like, enterprise valuation and velocity of growth and those kinds of things.    Yeah, yeah.\n  00:15:41 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      And how have you been able to do the correlation of your impact?\n  00:15:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I mean, that's a good question.    Look, I'm lean and mean, so I don't have some big fancy formula or spreadsheets on that, and I don't really need.    For what I'm doing, because I basically just, you know, I'm constantly focused on getting 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and a whole bunch of, you know, different startups that, you know, and then also my carry interest in this fund.    And so this is really more of just like my medium to long term strategy.    And as I'm doing this, I'm building.    So like, I'm about to become the first operating partner in venture that's focused on narrative.    Right.    So like, and so and we have a very, and with that, it's a very unique thesis, which we're first applying to the port codes, I'm already working with one of the port codes, we're going to apply it to the rest of them.    And then we're testing that out over the next six to 12 months.    And, you know, and basically, as we further test that out, like, the implication of this is us really putting this thesis out into the market at a broader level.    So I'm, I'm myself really focused on right now category creation, you know, and, and it's    Based on things like, I believe that language, in the context of AI, language is the last defensible moat.    So many other things are going to become commodity layers.    So how do you differentiate?    How do you position?    How do you create defensibility?    It's language, right?    And that language is a, so not only is language a defensible moat, but then also language is the new enterprise code base.\n  00:17:26 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yeah, yeah.\n  00:17:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so just like you need a data architecture, you need a design system, very few organizations are thinking about language as a system that needs architecture.    But when you get the architecture down, you can scale.    And actually, I work with a lot of data scientists, and they totally get this.    This is what ontology and heuristics is all about, but it hasn't translated into management speak.    And so I'm actually doing a lot of that grafting, and I've proved it out.    I've basically, in the last year and a half, have taken 20 years of my, like, narrative first...    Principles, those heuristics.    I've built a storied AI.    I use that with all of my clients and it allows me to create oversized results very fast because the ability of being able, like you can give me any strategy doc, any slide deck, and I can very quickly give you actionable languaging recommendations that make you fall off your chair because of my unique narrative heuristics that are like, that are very different.    And it's all about get, like right now, I'll give you a really simple example since you work in a workplace environment, like in kind of the workplace strategy stuff in a big enterprise.    So oftentimes the value of something from a semantic perspective is trapped four or five layers of click down.    So quick little anecdote.    I do a lot of work in, in, in, in, in bio, working with.    Amongst others, like one of the top 10 biopharma companies in the world, I'm doing this workshop, we're debriefing, and this executive starts talking about stuff, and they're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, DMT, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.    And I'm like, all right, hold on.    Pause for a moment.    I'm from California, hippie long hair.    When you say DMT, that means something very specific to me.    I don't think you're talking about tripping balls with the shamans in the jungle.    So slow it down.    What do we mean by DMT?    And actually, hold on, just a of hands.    How many people here in the room know what DMT is?    And maybe a third of the room raises their hand.    And she goes, oh, I'm sorry.    I'm sorry.    Of course, of course.\n  00:19:35 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      DMT is disease modification therapy.\n  00:19:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm like, oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.    No, okay, I didn't.    Okay, how many of you knew that?    Still only maybe half the room raises their hand.    I'm like, okay, so what is disease modification therapy?    She goes, oh, well, that is not, that is not curing an illness.    It's slowing or stopping its progression.    I'm like, oh.    OK, now we're getting a little warmer.    Well, what does that mean?    Your loved ones can live longer.    Ding, ding, ding, ding.    Yeah, yeah.\n  00:20:07 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      OK.\n  00:20:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So this is what's going on.    This is like the alphabet soup tower of Babel happening in all organizations.    And then on top of that, you have semantic drift, which is how a word like roadmap or a like a KPI, like meaningful social interaction or whatever those things are, mean different things to the different functional disciplines, to the different business divisions and so on.    So there is not actual linguistic semantic alignment.    And that's one of the biggest drag coefficients.    Not only like because everybody wants velocity, right?    Everybody wants velocity.    So we have to reduce friction.\n  00:20:48 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      The number one source of friction that's a hidden source of friction is language.\n  00:20:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And so this is what's going on in all organizations with change and transformation.    And now here comes AI.    AI.    Where your outputs are only as good as your inputs.    So if you don't solve for this semantic drift, you're literally introducing noise into all of the downstream outputs and outflows.    Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n  00:21:14 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Absolutely.    Gosh, I see that.    Totally.    Everything that comes out of our AI system is just reinforcing the lingo.\n  00:21:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah.\n  00:21:25 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      That's so interesting.    Yeah, so that's my theory of change right now that I'm like going right after this thing.    It's a root cause diagnosis.\n  00:21:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The narrative problem is basically upstream of all other problems.    And if get the story straight, it's a force multiplier.\n  00:21:39 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      That's awesome.    So I didn't set this up with like a specific project in mind, but after this conversation, I do want to introduce you to our head of strategy who's leading all of our transformation work.    Because I think to what I was saying earlier, I mean, certainly for my own team.    We love it, but for the broader organization, the way that you're talking about this really resonates to where we have the most issues.    And it's interesting, like one of our biggest initiatives that has been going on for a while, but it's still a challenge, it's called One JLL.    It's very original, but basically how we work across silos, and we still really struggle with it.    And a lot of it is because we all use the same word to describe different things.\n  00:22:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What are three key words that you have this semantic drift at JLL, of curiosity?\n  00:22:36 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Well, they tend to be services to clients.    So transactions is a really big one.    A lot of people touch transactions in different ways.    Change management.    Client relationship management.    Executive oversight.    What does it actually mean to come together?    Yeah,    They're in different roles for a single client, like those kind of things.    Sorry.\n  00:23:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      There's a lot of like, it's a lot of governance and decision rights and that kind of stuff.\n  00:23:11 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      yeah, like we, multiple groups do change management for clients or multiple groups do portfolio strategy or, oh gosh, experience.    Experience is probably the biggest one.    Wow.    Yeah.\n  00:23:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Experience is like the jargon word of the industry though.    Yes.\n  00:23:29 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Yep.    At least in my industry.\n  00:23:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I love it.    Thank you for those examples.    Yeah.\n  00:23:35 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      So would you be open to that?    need to reach out the same as Ben, but I'll reach out to him if it makes sense and where we're at in the process.    But if, yeah, I think it'd be great to connect you guys.\n  00:23:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let me, let me plant two little seeds, two other things too, to just be mindful of from a kind of multi-threaded perspective.    One is, is, um, uh, I have an    ongoing thread with Robert Kohler, kind of coming out of the session.    And so I don't if you're matrixed with him, but you might be useful to kind of ping him.    And then the other one is that I met with a few folks on the commercial side, including, I want to, who was it, David Poplar.    And then I also met briefly his boss.    And there is an AI solution that I can recommend that's a startup that I've advised, that I've been advising and working with called storypath.ai.    And these guys specialize in increasing or accelerating deal velocity by being able to speak in the language of the buyer.    And so this is about, it's working with the most complex technical hard to explain stuff.    And they're-    Their clients include Salesforce, Oracle, Modern Treasury, you name it.    They're just coming out of stealth.    And they're even working with Google.    Like people who basically start working with them are like, we can't do this ourselves.    So they have this really high signal way to basically raise the floor on all your sellers.    For them to be able to speak like true trusted advisors and to know how to move through the decision gates of the sales process.\n  00:25:24 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Amazing.    Using storytelling and narrative frameworks for like every kind of presentation through the process.    I mentioned that because that's obviously like an enterprise grade, like scalable solution that's still quite affordable.\n  00:25:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That also, you could also use it for internal purposes.    But yeah, that might be another thing to take a look at.    I'm introducing David to the CEO of StoryPath.    They're also happy to send you information on them if that's part of another kind of resource for consideration.\n  00:25:57 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Okay, cool.    Yeah, I'll chat with both David and Robin.    And, yeah, we'll coordinate and get him back to you.\n  00:26:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Sounds good.    Cool.    Thanks, Michael.\n  00:26:05 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      good to up, Amanda.\n  00:26:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Talk soon.    You too.\n  00:26:07 - Amanda.Kross (Jones Lang LaSalle)\n      Bye.    Bye.\n",
