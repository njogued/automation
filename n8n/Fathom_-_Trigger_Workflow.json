Your writing style reflects the guidelines from Michael’s guidelines and swipe files documents, especially for sales meetings and client session follow-ups, emphasizing direct language, clear next steps, and a professional yet approachable tone. Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

Happy Friday.\n  00:00:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Happy Friday.\n  00:00:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Happy Friday.    And welcome back.    Thank you.\n  00:00:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Thank you.    How was Milken?\n  00:00:37 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Really good.\n  00:00:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I learned a lot.\n  00:00:40 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I really deepened my partnership with Sabrina.\n  00:00:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think there's going to be a lot more to come out of that partnership.    And then I made significant progress on the work stream.    So the I built I built the core deck, the key messaging.    you.    Thank you.    Thank    That you helped me with.    I also sent her a recap of some themes and insights coming out of the session that she facilitated.    So there's a lot of good stuff.    Are you still with me or your video looks like it's frozen?    Thank you.\n  00:05:26 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay, I'm back, I'm back.    Sorry for that.    That's okay.\n  00:05:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I don't know if you heard it, I was just saying I made a lot of progress on Milken this week, the core, so the deck, the key messaging, as well as some insights from the session that she ran.    So all of that was great.\n  00:05:50 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Amazing, amazing.    Yes.\n  00:05:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right, so a few things.    By the way, the call with DNA stack was great.    That's Greenlight Go.    So the next step is, even though I had already sent them the SOW, we just want to resurface it for them to basically review and approve.    Mark, the CEO, is going to be the point of contact.\n  00:06:19 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.\n  00:06:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So include all three of them on the thread.    Oh, we should then update.    Let me actually update right now.    So client sponsor, instead of Ryan, needs to be Mark.    Mark.    Fume.    Okay.    Okay.    Um,    And then we actually want to wedge in a session starting next week.    They want to get cracking.    Good news is Wednesday at 11.30 Pacific works for them.    Okay.\n  00:07:25 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      So let's put that in.    Yeah.    Okay, so I should just send an invite right away?\n  00:07:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, send an invite right away because for two of them, they said it works.    know for both Kevin and Mark, it works.    And then let's see if Ryan can also join, but you might as well.    Let's just get it.    Let's just get it booked.\n  00:07:53 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Sounds good.    Great.\n  00:07:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, so that's that.    And then had a great session with Jeff Manson and WPS.    I got to send him a follow up.    Oh, I also had an amazing session with Twitch, with not just Mike, but he brought in his two deputies.    And basically, this session and our next session is a trial run for contract renewal, where I do a sprint that includes all three of them.    So that went really well.\n  00:08:36 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      So lots of good stuff.\n  00:08:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The one update that's been a little bit of a setback is Veridical Ventures is on hold.    And or is he wants or needs to slow that down.    So it's all right.    I trust the process.    We have our hands full with lots of things.    So that is the quick update there.    Okay, what else?    Oh, thank you for just shipping and making progress on the JD and getting that out.    That really made me happy that you didn't let it just bottleneck because I was a bit distracted.    So thank you for that.    Yes.\n  00:09:40 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Go ahead.    Yes, on that front, I just had a question on what you think about promoting the job itself based on the packages that LinkedIn has.    And I'm also wondering if it makes sense.    To make it more explicit that it's not data analysis or like technical, like technical analysis.    Totally.\n  00:10:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, so let me show you something that happened, which is, so there was a comment by someone here.    This guy, Jasper, who said fascinating role at the intersection of narrative strategy and AI, which is actually really well said, and then gave me two candidates plus this link to more.    And when I looked at these candidates, this one, by the way, is a great background.    Exactly.    Like they do prompt engineering, and then they also do a whole bunch of writing, brand voice, storytelling systems.    So I'm like, great.    So I've reached out to.    This person, right?\n  00:11:03 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      I was like, that's cool.\n  00:11:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then the second person that they recommended is this person who also fits the profile, but I have, when I went to, so similar, they have a messaging background, UX copy content messaging strategy, they do a lot of AI stuff.    I'm like, okay, great.    But then I read some of their content and I was like, meh, like, this was a little too confessional for me.    She was like, I'm not consistent.    I get distracted.    I have a hard time focusing and following through.    I'm like, yeah, I don't, I'm not looking for a messy creative.    I.    One, an analytical, disciplined, right?    So then I was like, okay, I won't reach out to them.    But the point is they identified two people that was like, ooh, so at the intersection of narrative strategy and AI.    So let's actually do the following.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    And so a couple of things, by the way, one is I think that I should keep reposting this in a variety of ways over the next couple of weeks.    I think I should do something that actually have like a photo of me instead of this, like personal photos perform better.    And then, oh, back to this guy.    So then, yeah, so then let's open this up.    And, okay, so because I went through and I like pulled them some that weren't a fit, like I went through some of the profiles and then they gave me some more recommendations.    Um, and.    Um.    Um.    Thank you.    And, okay, so this one is a no.    There are two senior, two senior, and the focus is too much on film and TV narrative business.    Anyways, I was wondering whether we should pay for the, I don't know if we need to pay for the upgraded version, because basically it says you can do five searches for free.    Um, but basically I was kind of like, how can we, how can we use this?\n  00:14:56 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.\n  00:14:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, now I gave it feedback.    And it was supposed to rerun to give me new people.    Because like, here's another example of someone, and like, this person is too senior.    Yeah.\n  00:15:15 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Right.\n  00:15:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Way too senior, but it is interesting.    And here's, by the way, how I think about this, I don't want someone too senior, because they are, you ever, are familiar with the phrase, an empty cup?\n  00:15:33 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yes.    Yeah, right.\n  00:15:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And it's like, you know, it's like the Zen master that like, you know, keeps pouring the tea into the cup and keeps pouring and pouring and, right.    And then the students like, why are you doing this?    And people, it's like, well, because like, you have to empty your cup.    Like, if I work with someone who's too experienced, they're going to have these biases.    They're already certain there is.\n  00:15:58 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yes.\n  00:15:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And    Have you ever eaten at a sushi restaurant, like Japanese sushi?    Are familiar with Japanese sushi?\n  00:16:07 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      I'm familiar with it, never had it.\n  00:16:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So there's a tradition in Japanese sushi, which is before you ever become a Japanese sushi chef, the first thing you do is you sweep the floor, right?\n  00:16:22 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      And you're going to sweep the floor for weeks.\n  00:16:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then after you sweep the floor for weeks, then you might graduate and be given the privilege to make the rice.\n  00:16:30 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      And then for months, you're making the rice, okay?\n  00:16:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then after a while, you graduate and you make the egg omelet, right?    And there's like this apprenticeship process.    And, you know, I want someone that has some experience and has some skills, but what we do is very specific, right?    It's the Margolis method.    I need someone that's empty cup who wants to like immerse themselves and learn and apply this method.    Mm-hmm.\n  00:17:01 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Wax on, Wax off, fast.    You got it.\n  00:17:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.    Wax on.    Do you know that's the origin behind the name Storied?\n  00:17:10 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      How so?\n  00:17:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      A friend of mine, 25 years ago, we were sitting around talking about my work, and she just threw out this phrase, Wax on, Wax off, Get Storied.\n  00:17:24 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Mm-hmm.\n  00:17:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I was like, Get Storied.    And so for many years, the name of the company was Get Storied before we became just Storied.\n  00:17:32 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      But it comes from exactly that.    Amazing.    Amazing.    Yeah.    Yeah.\n  00:17:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So you get it.    Anyways, I just want you to keep that in mind of the profile we're looking for.\n  00:17:43 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.\n  00:17:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because I do think if you have some time, I would love for you to go through and identify some more candidates here.    Like.    going through all of this.    And let's take a look at this one here.    Okay, Rhea Uphall, marketing, communications, corporate comms, using AI, seven years experience, independent consultants.    So that's the other thing, by the way, that's really important.    I'm, I'm looking, we're looking for someone who's an independent consultant, freelancer, or, um, solopreneur.\n  00:18:31 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Right.    We don't want someone who's in a full-time role at a company because we're not offering a full-time role yet.\n  00:18:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Yep.\n  00:18:38 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Um, okay.\n  00:18:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, um, so yeah, so they fit the mix.    I would make, make them a yes.    Um, so experience, AI Native, and you.    So part of this, too, when you give it feedback, you're basically training their algorithm.    I hope it improved the suggestions.    Yep.    Okay, so now, all right, they've already gated us.    We do need to pay now to get more recommendations.    So I'm going to go ahead and upgrade.    So here's what I want us to do.    I'm happy to spend $100 this month, right?    Or even if we end up doing for two months, what I want you to do, though, is keep track.    So today's November 7th.    This is going to renew on December 7th.    So if you can put in a reminder, maybe three or four days beforehand for us to just check in, hey, are we still in active search?    Do we want to keep renewing this?    But running this for a month or two, I think is actually a really cool...    I like the way that they're using AI to really identify our ideal profile.    that can use try    So, all right.\n  00:20:20 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      What happened?    The expiry is missing.    Yeah, I'm pulling it up.\n  00:20:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So if you look at the comments from people as well on the job post.    Yeah.    Is a lot of people, like those who commented were like, might be the coolest job description I've ever read, right?    Or like, this sounds like a really cool opportunity, you know, wrong, wrong time zone, but stunning opportunity for the right storyteller.    Oh, wow, what a dream job.    You know, I almost want to move to the US just to apply.    So what this tells us is, this is really unique and compelling.    What we need to do is raise our eyeballs.    We need to get this in front of more people and more of the right people.\n  00:21:32 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yes.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    So we constantly send out posts about the opening.    Yes.\n  00:21:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    So yeah, so no, I think about it this way, like, you have permission to go spend $1,000 on recruiting.    So whatever it is, whether it's LinkedIn ads, or if there's other things that we should consider.    But, you know, we can even put more budget to it.    But just know that, like, I don't mind spending some money right now.    We want to build volume and funnel of candidates.    Okay.\n  00:22:10 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay?    Yeah.\n  00:22:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Sweet.    Okay.    All right.    Oh, one point of feedback.    When I was on the road, you put together a document that was like, hey, Michael, these are some things for you to focus on.    In the future, do me a favor and don't put it in a Word doc.    Just put the whole thing into Slack channel.    Because as a Word doc, what it did was it was like a couple levels of click down away from my brain.    So I didn't bother to open it until like the last hour of my flight.    Yeah.\n  00:22:56 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      And I was like, oh, .\n  00:22:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So I got all these other, I got all my clients.    And I was like, Oh, what's this?    I should I should look at this.    But so I only got so far.    And then my internet was acting funny.    But the good news is actually, I'm like 70% done with testimonials.    Okay, and I was creating, by the way, short versions of them.    So I took some of the best ones.    And then I had chat GPT sort of make them even more concise, which is gonna be really useful.    And then I looked at your draft email for client portal, and it was super strong.    I just did a couple micro micro edits.    So on Monday, I'll pick that up.    The one thing I need to do is actually go into the notion and proof the client portal there, but we will ship client portal next week.\n  00:23:42 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Fantastic.    Yeah, so great work.\n  00:23:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great, great work.    And yeah, and just keep in mind, sometimes, you know, you're dealing with my ADHD brain, you know, sometimes you kind of you need to pin me to the ground.    Michael, I want you to look at this.    Hey, Michael, just checking in.    Where are we at with this?    Like, I need those reminders.    Thank    I just get so distracted.    So just know that you're never, you're never a nuisance.    You're never overstepping by keeping us accountable to our shared agreements of the things that we say matter or what we're trying to advance.\n  00:24:14 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.    And you can always be like, hey, Michael, this has been aging.\n  00:24:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Is this still a priority?    Or how, you know, what should we reset as the new target?    So you can enroll me kind of the like, let's recalibrate.    But until you tell me that this is backlogged, I'm going to keep driving down the field and get this, you know, make sure that we're getting this done.    Get you, Michael, bottleneck out of the way or, you know, I'm just going to go ship this thing.    Like I was so happy that you shipped the LinkedIn stuff in the job description because my little brain had been like, oh, but I want to perfect this and I want to do that.    But you just shipped it.    And then once it was live, great.    I went into the job description on LinkedIn and I made a couple edits.    And then I was like, oh, by the way, Edward, there's enough.    It's version.    It's fine.    It's good enough.    Let's not let perfection be the enemy of done.    But I get caught up with that.    So just know that that's one of my Achilles heels.\n  00:25:12 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Cool.\n  00:25:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    All right.    So, what did they come back to?    Okay.    Oh, by the way, so it looks like now, this is so funny, all this stuff.    IRS now has updated the mailing address to our corporate address, which is fine.    So we don't need to submit that other form.\n  00:25:48 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Okay.    What's that?\n  00:25:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Did they just update it out of the blue?    Yeah, it's probably from like a filing that we made.    That had that address.\n  00:26:01 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      then it sort of got updated.\n  00:26:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, but that's the notification I just got from our virtual mailbox.\n  00:26:08 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Okay.\n  00:26:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Sweet.    Okay.    So I will, let me go and shift gears.    I want to go and do, I want to go focus on the newsletter.    Let me figure out whatever micro edits need to be made there so that that can get loaded up.    And then let's make sure that we ship an email follow up to DNA stack today.    And I will also ship a follow up to, to WPS.    So for DNA stack, basically generate our classic onboarding email.    That's like coming out of SOW call.    Like.    A great call.    Here's the SOW again.    Mark it up.    The next steps are blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.    I know you want to move fast.    We can kick off on Wednesday.    I've just sent the invite.    Once we've got this confirmed, I'll take actions on all the next onboarding, all that kind of stuff.    Or Edward will take action on XYZ.\n  00:27:21 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    Sweet.    All right.\n  00:27:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So we've got that done.    Is there anything else that I'm forgetting or overlooking that you can think of?\n  00:27:35 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Just a few admin things.    Yeah.    Pending, but not urgent.    First one is the car wash.    Just wondering when you want to schedule that since it's been five weeks since the last one.    Yeah.\n  00:27:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's go ahead and get it scheduled.    Um, Um,    Ah, I'm on the fence, though.    I was not really happy with the quality this last time.    And it's been, it's basically the quality has been going downhill.    Here's what I want you to do.    I want you to reach out to the business owner.    think his name is Curtis.\n  00:28:26 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.    Okay.\n  00:28:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I want you to say to him, Hey, you know, it's time for our next car wash.    Yeah.    Michael, Michael has basically like, how do you say this?    Like, to be honest, our last car wash wasn't to a very good standard.    The outside, basically, like they never did like    They never did any kind of clay treatments.    And whatever they did do, like the car, the car enamel looked dirty within like two or three days.\n  00:29:10 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.\n  00:29:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So like, this is this is kind of last chance.    Like, send us your best person.    Okay, I want to try one last time.    But so sort of say something like that.    Okay.    And then I'll try it one last time.    And then after that, then we'll just we'll we'll move on and find a different vendor going forward.    Okay.    Okay.\n  00:29:43 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Great.    And what's what days would you prefer to have them come over?\n  00:29:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You can figure that out by basically looking at my calendar, looking at the car share calendar and or my personal calendar of my    I has marked anything going on.    And then book accordingly.    I would say that oftentimes that Mondays is often one of the best days.    But yeah, I'll let you figure it out.    The other thing that has been pending is the California Scholar 529 accounts.    Yes.    So for that, what I'd like you to do is, so keep in mind that Tuesday Afternoons is my admin block.\n  00:31:00 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.\n  00:31:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So I would love for you to basically resurface it for me for 4 p.m.    on Tuesday, as well as any other key admin things for Tuesday, 4 p.m.\n  00:31:21 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      All right.    Sounds good.    Great.\n  00:31:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great, great, great.    All right.    You're working on a reschedule with Syndio for later in the month, right?\n  00:31:45 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yes.    I believe we already set that up, but it was pushed to after Thanksgiving.    Maria had a bunch of travel.\n  00:31:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Cool.    I don't...    See it on the calendar yet for after Thanksgiving.    And I just remembered an email thread where they proposed that, but I didn't see you respond to it.    So I don't know if I was, if I was just not CC'd, but I don't see.    Oh, now I see.    Okay.    So she's now on the calendar for December 12th.    Okay.    Yep.\n  00:32:17 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Got it.\n  00:32:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Cool.    All right.    Hey, Edward, any idea why or how for family car schedule?    Yeah.    Elle added this writing workshop that she's going to do.    Why would that show up in this dark blue instead of like my light blue car schedule?\n  00:33:24 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      I don't know.    Will you take a screenshot and see if you can fix it?\n  00:33:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because otherwise, because that blue, right, like looks very similar to like my sales call blue.    And so it just creates cognitive dissonance for me when I look at the calendar and it's not like in a light gray kind of color for the car.    Yeah.\n  00:33:48 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.\n  00:33:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, great.    So yeah, that's on December 11th is the example of it.    Although it looks like also on December 4th.    I think that's a reoccurring.    Yeah.    So it's a reoccurring thing for her.\n  00:34:00 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Cool.\n  00:34:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    Cool.    This, by the way, this ACQ AI virtual implementation workshop, this is super relevant.    We should get the recording of it.    Maybe just email them to confirm.    That's this piece.    By the way, this, you get on it by using my Google single sign-on.    But since it's recorded on YouTube, there should then be a recording afterwards.    I'm not going to sit there for four hours, but I definitely would like to get access to looking at it.    you.    Thank    Okay.    All right.    Anything else?\n  00:35:11 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Truly.\n  00:35:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, here's the link for recruiting with Cortine.    This is the recruiting AI software.    I want you on Monday to review and identify top candidates.    And just to remind you, the way that you want to use this is you scroll through these candidates.    You either go no, maybe, or yes.    And if it's, you know, I tend to click on the LinkedIn to then kind of get a better sense of them.\n  00:35:57 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Right.\n  00:35:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, and then you get.    Give it feedback because it learns off the feedback.    So if I go no, it then asks me to check off some things and or give it some things or similarly, yes.    What were the reasons?    Yes.    And then once you've done a few of them, you can then go up here and refine search.    And since we now are on the $100 plan, which is unlimited search, we can keep training the algo and improving outputs.    But I would start by basically going through this full stack and then have it rerun.    And yeah, let's see what it generates.\n  00:36:37 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Cool.\n  00:36:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Amazing.    Amazing.\n  00:36:41 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      All right.\n  00:36:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So yeah, take action on that as well as the LinkedIn ad.    Oh, and actually a question on the LinkedIn ad is also the difference between there was all.    There's like a way to, let see here, it shows up this way.    Yeah, so look at here.    There's also like, I can boost this post.\n  00:37:10 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah.\n  00:37:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so I'm curious about, is boosting a post the same as just putting an ad for a job?\n  00:37:23 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      I think, I think when you boost, it doesn't go to, I think the main difference is that a job that is a paid ad goes directly to the jobs page, which makes it easier for people who are looking for jobs to find it.    Versus boosting just appears in more feeds for people, even though they may not be particularly looking for the job.\n  00:37:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So let's do a combination of both, because I think a boosted post is actually better signal.    Because a boosted post is going to go to my first level and second level.    connections.\n  00:38:01 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah, yeah.    Right.    So we're going to have less of this rando crap.\n  00:38:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But actually, it's just me getting broader reach of actually the people who already have a relationship with me.\n  00:38:12 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    So here, I'm going to set this thing up.\n  00:38:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But you know what, I'm going to leave this, I want to run this on Monday, I don't want to run it over the weekend.    I don't think that's going to give us as good performance.    Okay, but we'll, we'll go there.    Okay, cool.    All right, so I'll do that.    But yeah, let's really focus on recruiting next week of like, what are the next steps there?    Yes.\n  00:38:38 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Great.\n  00:38:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    Let me take a break.    And then I'll go work on the newsletter.\n  00:38:46 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Okay.    Sounds good.    All right.    Thanks so much.\n  00:38:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And before we before we sign off, let's make sure that we have a newsletter that's, that's uploaded into kit, even if I do any micro tweaks over the weekend.\n  00:38:58 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Yeah, yeah.    Sweet.    All right.\n  00:39:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.\n  00:39:01 - Edward Njogu (2)\n      Thanks again.\n  00:39:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Thanks, Michael.    Bye.    Cheers.
