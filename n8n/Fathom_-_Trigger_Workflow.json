Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_summary": "Meeting Purpose\n\nTo explore storytelling coaching for portfolio founders.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  - The Problem: Technical founders struggle to sell a \"speculative future,\" often focusing on product features over a compelling, high-integrity narrative.\n  - The Solution: Michael Margolis's advisory uses \"storied AI\" (trained on 25+ proprietary heuristics) to elevate pitches from functional utility (\"the what\") to aspirational value, a key differentiator in the AI era.\n  - The Offer: Two engagement models are available: a 6-month bi-weekly retainer ($7.5k–$8.5k/mo) or a 90-day weekly sprint ($12k/mo). Michael has bandwidth for 1–2 new clients in Q1 2026.\n  - The Strategy: Scale by protecting the core high-touch service. Michael will use storied AI to train and certify coaches, replicating his method without diluting the premium experience.\n\nTopics\n\nThe Problem: Founder Storytelling Gap\n\n  - Matt Smith (Kickstart) notes that storytelling is the only asset for early-stage founders with no product or traction.\n  - Technical founders often struggle with this, as their training prioritizes empirical proof over selling a speculative future.\n  - This gap is a key differentiator; founders with sales experience who have faced rejection tend to be better storytellers.\n\nThe Solution: Michael Margolis's Advisory\n\n  - Michael Margolis's 23-year focus is on telling the story of innovation, viewing language as the new code base.\n  - His advisory model combines high-touch facilitation with a proprietary tool, storied AI.\n  - storied AI: Trained on 25+ proprietary heuristics, it analyzes strategy docs and decks to provide actionable language recommendations.\n      - Goal: Elevate pitches from functional utility (\"the what\") to emotional and aspirational value.\n  - Engagement Models:\n      - 6-Month Retainer: Bi-weekly meetings for $7,500–$8,500/month.\n      - 90-Day Sprint: Weekly meetings for $12,000/month.\n  - Client Profile: Michael is shifting from large tech companies (Meta, Google) to earlier-stage startups (Seed–Series C), often connected to the venture ecosystem.\n\nThe Strategy: Scaling High-Touch Service\n\n  - Michael's challenge is scaling his high-touch, facilitator-led model without diluting its premium value.\n  - Matt's Advice: Protect the high-touch core.\n      - Method: Use storied AI to train and certify internal coaches, replicating Michael's method.\n      - Rationale: This maintains the premium experience, which is the core value proposition, unlike the low-margin, high-volume B2C online course model Michael previously explored.\n\nNext Steps\n\n  - Matt Smith: Introduce Michael Margolis to a portfolio founder who needs storytelling coaching.\n  - Michael Margolis: Send two copies of his book to Matt Smith and Dalton Wright.\n",

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I feel you.    Where in the Midwest are you located?    Are you in Denver?\n  00:00:06 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I'm in Denver, yes.\n  00:00:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Awesome.    Is where you're from?\n  00:00:10 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      No, I'm from Salt Lake.    So I don't know if you know Kickstart, but we're one of the first seed funds outside the coast, headquartered in Salt Lake.    And then me and one of our partners moved to Denver two years ago about and opened a second office.    But we've been investing in Colorado since 2013, really.\n  00:00:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      About 25 portfolio companies out here.\n  00:00:30 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      But it was time for some boots on the ground.\n  00:00:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So we opened another office.    Very cool.    Very cool.    And the Broncos are ascending.    So you must be having some fun.\n  00:00:40 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      That's true.    It's a good time.    As a Utah kid, I had no NFL team.    And so I'm like torn between Steve Young.    was a BYU kid.    So Steve Young, I was a Niners guy.    All my family were Niners fans.    So you're a Puka fan?\n  00:00:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:00:56 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Big Puka guy.    Let's go rant.    Um...    But yeah, anyway, I'm like torn.    like happy.    Like, it's fun.    Everyone's buzzing about the Broncos.    And I'm like, I'm new enough to town.    like, do I adopt the Broncos?    It feels wrong.    I don't know.    Well, but it's an AFC, NFC thing.\n  00:01:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So you can have your, you know, you got your conference plays.\n  00:01:18 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      That's fair.\n  00:01:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's cool.\n  00:01:21 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      You're in LA, right?\n  00:01:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.\n  00:01:24 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Are you from the area?\n  00:01:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I grew up actually in Switzerland.    First nine years.    I was born in the States, but three months old, moved to Switzerland, was there as a kid.    And then I moved to LA when I was nine, was here through high school, left for 25 years and moved back in like 2018 now.    So what is that?    Six years or so?    Seven years.\n  00:01:45 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Where in Switzerland do you live?\n  00:01:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      A little suburb of Lausanne on the French speaking side.\n  00:01:51 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Cool.    I lived in Geneva for six months.    A little suburb, Chambé-Z, which is like up to the lake there.    Yeah.    That's so cool.\n  00:02:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, my dad worked for Nestle.    He is a mad scientist and inventor.    So he used to run a product development plant, you know, inventing like natural decaffeination process for coffee and, you know, chocolates and cereals.    So that's where I got my addiction to chocolate from.\n  00:02:18 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      So I'm assuming you spent some time at like the Maison Cahiers, the kind of like museum, the OG Nestle house.    Yes.\n  00:02:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I was actually on our last trip back as a family.    It was my parents 50th wedding anniversary.    is probably like four or five years ago.\n  00:02:36 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I actually went for the first time or at least as an adult.    Maybe I went as a kid.\n  00:02:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I didn't remember.    But yeah, we actually we actually went to Vevey and and went there.    was really cool.    That's very fun.\n  00:02:45 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    So I, I went back and did an internship in college in Paris, and I had just gotten married.    Like a nice senior year, got married young.    And we took all sorts of like little trips around.    You're up on the weekend with my wife.\n  00:03:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But that was her favorite spot.\n  00:03:03 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      was like, oh, Spain's nice.    Everyone's great.    But we went to Lausanne and the kind of central Switzerland.    And she was like, oh, I could live here forever.    This is the place.\n  00:03:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But it was a great place to grow up as a kid.    And I had the best of it because I escaped.    Like once you hit middle school, like the education system there is severe.    And, you know, and very, you know, you very much get put on a track.    You're either, you know, the white, white collar job or they send you off to a trade school.    And it's just what I've heard that just like education there is, is just, it's intense.\n  00:03:41 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    You kind of pick you.    That's right.    You got to pick your path when you're like 14.\n  00:03:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Super young.    I don't know if I want to be an engineer.    Super, super young.    So, but it was great growing up as a kid there.    And then, you know, Swiss Lederhosenboy and surfer skater culture of West.    LA in 1986.\n  00:04:02 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      was, there were some brutal years.    Yeah.    Good character building.\n  00:04:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's cool.\n  00:04:06 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      So how did you get to story?    Like what's the kind of origins?\n  00:04:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Man, I'm a dog with a bone.    So, mean, I've been, I've been thinking of me as a narrative nerd.    I'm obsessed with how to tell the story of innovation and the story of disruption because it's one of the hardest stories to tell.    Like by definition, you're doing something that's pushing the boundaries.    You're questioning or challenging assumptions.    You're challenging the status quo.    And it creates a lot of reverb, a lot of defensiveness, a lot of resistance, a lot of objections.    And I, I sort of, so when I started, all of this was actually my first career right out of uni.    I was a social entrepreneur.    So applying business principles to social change.    And I was working on the digital divide.    So basically back in the late nineties, the new internet economy, half a million tech jobs going on.    I was at the right place at the right time.    was in Boston, and there was a whole mafiosi of social enterprise there.    And I basically fell into co-founding and running one of the first national nonprofits that was focusing on technology workforce development out of urban inner city communities.    I had a lot of very quick early success, was funded by the biggest name foundations in the country.    And then within a couple years, it all kind of fell apart.    So it was quarter-life crisis, kind of walking away from all of that, going, why do so many world-changing ideas get lost in translation?    Like, what is it about that?    And I'm trained as a cultural anthropologist.    And so it was really just kind of like having a tiger by the tail.    And I'm like, there's something here, this story stuff, this innovation stuff.    So it's now been 22, 23 years, something like that.    And just so happens, the thing I'm obsessed with and have been geeking out on has, over that time period, become more.    And more not only relevant, but prescient, especially now with AI and LLMs where, you know, language is the last defensible moat.\n  00:06:10 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      It's part of my thesis.\n  00:06:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And even furthermore, language is the new code base.    So this is a lot of where my work is going these days where just like you need a data architecture or you need a design system in order to scale.    There are very few companies that are looking at language as a system or as an architecture that actually becomes the force multiplier for whatever you want you're doing and how fast you can move.\n  00:06:37 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    Yeah, that's cool.    I mean, as a seed investor, so much of what we're investing in is people that can tell a good story.\n  00:06:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      There's no data yet, really.    There's no, it's exactly this.\n  00:06:48 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      It's like, hey, there's, here's the future that doesn't exist yet that we're building.    And the only way in my experience to like get kind of conviction around a founder is like you need to be able to see hundreds of people.    People tell a story and be like, so many of you are really bad at this.    Like, you're just not telling a story.    You're obsessed.    So many of them, so product eccentric, know, like, hey, here's my widget and it works.    But they can't, like, get up and look at the horizon and tell me, like, why their widget matters.    I find that it's the founders that have had some level of sales experience where they've been told no a bunch of times.    Then they kind of realize, like, oh, the only way for me to get whatever I'm trying to sell through the door, I have to learn how to, like, tell a story around it.    Yes.    Which is interesting.    think it's, I mean, obviously, like, so, you know, coming from Utah, there's all the missionary, there's, like, the sales culture.    People have learned, they've been told no a lot.    Yes.    They learned the story, though.    And it just was like, oh, yeah, everyone can do this.\n  00:07:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Everyone knows how to sell.    Everyone knows how to sell.\n  00:07:47 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      But in Colorado, a lot of really technical founders, they just don't, they don't storytell.\n  00:07:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, I was just about to speak to the technical founder piece.    So here's the inherent challenge.    And I thought I've.    And    A lot of my career over the last, especially 10 plus years has been in big tech.    So I was deeply embedded inside Meta for seven years, worked with 14 product and organizational divisions on the narratives that would go in front of Mark and the rest of the management team on like their big, big bets.    And then I've worked with basically, you know, the Facebook mafia and everywhere else that people have gone.    And the thing with technical founders is that if you're technical, you tend to be a precise achiever that's a high fact finder.    And you've made your name on, again, like the, on your, on technical competency.    And the challenge with that is that if you're a founder or if you're in a startup, what you're having to do is sell a speculative future and not just sell a speculative future, but you have to bring integrity to the.    And that's something rhetorically that a lot of highly technical people, there's basically like a ceiling or sort of a script in their brain that you have to reprogram because part of it to them is sacrilegious.    They're like, I cannot represent something that I don't have the empirical evidence and proof of, you know, of the precedent and blah, blah, blah, you know, and like, well, actually, there's ways you can do this rhetorically that still are super high integrity that, right?    And so it's, that's part of the shift is what I found.    Yeah, that's totally fair.\n  00:09:37 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      It's like pitching isn't lying, right?    Like it's storytelling.    It's like, you know, selling a narrative.\n  00:09:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, it's framing it.    Yeah, totally.\n  00:09:47 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      That's really interesting.    So would you say like, I, I was asking Keith, you know, he's had a great experience.    It's been really positive, but like the engagement typically with.    Founders is, there's like a, there's kind of an ongoing kind of set of like pre-built curriculum and coursework, but then there's also sessions with you.    How does it, how do you actually kind of stage out a normal engagement?    Like I have a handful of founders and I'm like, honestly, this might be worth just like hitting up Michael, but I'm sure that you can't scale perfectly.    There's a lot of people that need this ability.    So like you, how do you kind of thread the needle of pre-built content versus like actual support and help?\n  00:10:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's great question, Matt.    And, and, you know, to, to be perfectly candid, it's something that like I'm in the midst of figuring out right now, because I've gone through a lot of growth.    You know, three years ago, I had a professional services company and 10 full-time staff, and we were building big strategic narratives, multi six-figure level investments.    And then we were building storytelling as a capability, running trainings inside every, every tech company you can imagine.    With all the evolutions in the world of tech.    And then what happened with.    I stripped everything down to the studs and built more of a company of one in terms of my core engine.    Now I do 80% advisory work and then I do some speaking.    But what I have done is I have built storied AI that has been trained on 25 plus of my proprietary narrative heuristics.    And that's my secret sauce right now.    Because I'm able to, and maybe Keith shared this with you, like during our sale, even as we were in the sales process, what I'm able to do is you give me a strategy doc, you give me a pitch deck.    I'm able to run it through my storied AI and provide actionable languaging recommendations that make you fall off your chair.    Because it's been trained on my 20 years worth of work and it addresses this issue of moving out of functional utility.    As in the what and the how, which is where everybody indexes and moving up the value ladder to emotional value and aspirational value.    And ways to frame things that wins in the boardroom.    So right now, I'm very focused on, you know, I built the first gen of this.    It's overperforming, you know, and as you know, when you're building an AI, you can go really quick with some Fisher-Price tools and like get stuff going.    So I've got that.    I'm now actually building like the vector database and, and RAG and like the, having it.    So it's an actual true, like ever growing learning machine.    So that's a key piece to what I'm doing.    And then I have like anywhere between like 12 to 16 advisory clients at any one time.    And speaking to your exact question, I'm going through a little bit of a, of a, of an, of a quick R&D cycle starting in.    Q1, where I am going to be doing work because I'm doing a lot more work in across the venture and startup ecosystem.    And so I have a few slots that are instead of six months, they're 90 days.    And we're meeting weekly instead of biweekly, where we basically do a short sprint to build what I call the codex.    Because as you know, when you're working with AI, your outputs are only as good as your inputs.\n  00:13:28 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Right.\n  00:13:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So if you can build the ontology of this is the overarching strategic narrative, here's the messaging matrix, or we apply it to either, you know, oftentimes I'm working with like I have a startup right now I'm working with that they're in the genomic space, actually raising $200 million in Q1.    Right.    So we're focusing on the investment narrative.    And in their case, they actually have four strategic investment partners of where that's coming from.    So they kind of have like hardwired paths, but we need the about 2022,    The meta narrative, and then we need to like right size it to each of those four investment partners that represent different players across the value chain.\n  00:14:09 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      So sometimes it's an investment narrative.\n  00:14:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Other times it's go to market storytelling and that sales deck category creation.    So I'm not giving you like the perfect clean answer other than it's very much on my mind.    Yeah, I'm an educator by application.    So the long term arc of this is being able to provide people like, here's the actual code base of this stuff.    Here's the first principles.    And you can interact with it, you can apply it, you can get trained on it.    And then me continue to do very selective engagements, where I also have skin in the game for the enterprise value that I'm unlocking and helping people to accelerate velocity.\n  00:14:54 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    So, like, is Keith doing, he's doing every two weeks, but...    And there's also some content sessions.    I guess just from a brass tacks standpoint, I guess one, should I be pointing folks to you?    You're like, yeah, I've got bandwidth.    I can do it.    You're like, man, I'm already tapped out.    And then what should I kind of set expectations on what that looks like?\n  00:15:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    So I'd love for us to be building a relationship.    I have a very close relationship with Greg over at Veridical.    And that's obviously how I started working with Keith.    So right now, what I would say to you is I potentially have bandwidth for one, maybe two of your port codes in Q1.    Part of why I'm force functioning things into the 90 day sprint, and I used to do lots of 90 day sprints before, so I know I can do it, is I want to be able to have part of my portfolio is cycling so that I can actually work through a higher volume.    You know, across, across, you know, just based on opportunity flow.    So, so what does that look like brass tax?    Basically, and I've got, I'm making a slight adjustment on my rates, but starting for 2026, if we're working for six months, biweekly basis, it's like $7,500, $8,500.    If we're going for three months, and it's a weekly 90 day sprint, we're looking at 12,000 per month.    So the unit economics on this is still basically in the like 3540k range.    I de risk the process where people do, as a principal, you don't pay me unless I'm unlocking value.    So I have a process I go through to vet, you know, what your goals and interests, you what are you trying to accomplish equally?    Is this a good mutual fit?    If it goes through my own due diligence, like, I just don't have a fail rate.    Like, obviously, I'm also just like screening for like chemistry personality.    You know, a few of those things, but yeah, I can, I can tell you that, you know, the stuff works.    And it's because I take a first principles approach, which is where it's at first counterintuitive, although then people go, because we can, I can solve for complexity very quickly, which is what I like to, where I like to nerd out.\n  00:17:21 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    That makes sense.    That's cool.    Do you find you're typically kind of engaging is like a series A beyond, or is it pretty wide?\n  00:17:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, so yeah, historically I've worked a little bit further along in the maturity curve.    Like, so just in the last six months, I've been working with the CEO of a series C company that's in the HR tech space that, you know, is one of these, you know, a lot of the, a lot of the startups that, that, that basically like is struggling with how do we now, you know, we got funded under valuations in 2020, 2021, 2022.    2022.    Now we need to like make.    The leap to become like AI native.    And with that too, like our category is being fundamentally disrupted.    So it was a whole bunch of work with that CEO, the head of product and the head of comms.    And then I've done a lot of work that's more like scale ups, big tech.    So Meta, Google, Shopify, you know, and the like.    Like I'm right now doing a lot more work moving down into series A seed and even pre-seed, but stuff that is like strongly connected into the venture ecosystem.\n  00:18:35 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah.    Yeah, it's cool.    I mean, it's just like night and day, you know, the difference of a founder who can storytell.    it's, we, we actually, you know, we are kind of a nerdy group, but like we had our annual meeting two weeks ago and spent the first 15 minutes of it, like drawing Gandalf metaphors and storytelling.    Like it is, it is kind of part of our culture and like what we do.    But we even just internally, we just call them storytellers.    That's a good thing.    We'll walk out of a pitch meeting and people are like, oh, that's a storyteller.    It matters.    Because that's how you find the early employees.    It's how you get the first customers.    It's how you get investors to believe down the line.    Like when you have no traction and no product, all you have is a story.    That's all you have.    And I remind founders all the time, like, you're literally making this up as you go.    And that's okay.    Like this was in your brain and you're turning it into something.    It's okay that we're making this up as we go.    You just kind of have to own it.    And like, it's a real skill you need to craft.    So anyway, I think it's really cool.    Space kind of in problem spot that you're dealing with and building.    And it's cool.    It's needed.    It's very needed.\n  00:19:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I believe it's the future of not only the future of venture, but I believe it's the future for every and any enterprise.    That basically the narrative is upstream of every other problem that you face.    And because of what's going on with generative AI.    Like, language is your leverage.    And people don't have an awareness or an understanding or know how to actually execute on that.    Because you get the ontology down in the codex, you can then start deploying it at scale because of what AI can do.    But too many people, their strategy, the narrative, those things, there's so much noise that's in there.    So it's slop of what's coming out downstream.\n  00:20:26 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Well, I'm like, I meet with a lot of kind of early, you know, students, people trying to get an adventure, early career, you know, folks.    I've been telling them more and more, like, IQ is something become relatively commoditized.    But you still isn't.    And like, if you're gonna, you know, IQ might get in the door, but you is gonna what's gonna like, IQ will get you the conversation and EQ will get you in the door.    It's becoming even more and more valuable for anyone in their career.    But especially kind of like those in early stage startups, like, yeah.    So the dot, the knobs got cranked up on how important that is with AI.    So that's cool.\n  00:21:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Can ask you a question?\n  00:21:07 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Can I get your advice on something?\n  00:21:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So I've shared with you a little bit about what I'm up to and, you know, and you've seen, you know, kind of the proof in the pudding with Keith.    What is your take on how I think about the best way, the best interface for scaling this?    Because it's a real existential place that I'm at right now.    Like, at the end of the day, like, I look at this, Matt, like I'm 23 years into a 50 year project.    Like, that's how I've looked at this work.    And because I believe that this is like narrative intelligence, and I have a whole bunch of IP around that.    Like, this is a new management school of thought.    Like, this is the management science that everybody needs in this AI world.    And there's an educational component, but then obviously.    Obviously, there's the, there's an element of this, because it's, we're literally looking at the levers of thought and language.    It requires facilitation, right?    So there's always going to be this high touch component.    And I've got a bunch of different ways I'm looking at it.    But like, as someone who, you know, yourself, you invest in startups, you talk to founders, you know, what, and obviously, you have, you have both a port co, you know, port, you have portfolio and an ecosystem that that you engage in.    Like, what do you have any advice for me as to how I think about this?    And I have two young kids at home.\n  00:22:36 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Like I got a two year old and a six month old.\n  00:22:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I really care about also like, just, you know, like, I'm not look, I work really hard, but I'm not looking to like, you know, be a startup founder grinder that's doing 60, 80 hours a week.    That's not, that's not what I'm looking for.    I'm just trying to do really high leverage, you know, looking at maybe licensing, looking at how to license my IP package it for different verticals and so on.    But any advice?\n  00:23:00 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I think what makes it special is the high touch.    And especially in a world that's becoming more and more digital and more and more AI, it's the high touch that makes it refreshing.    It's the double-edged sword of what makes it hard to grow and scale.    But, you know, I think it would be – I think you're probably thinking down the right lines of you have to protect the high touch.    So the way you do that is through licensing, through franchising, through kind of like building your own kind of, if you will, your storytellers that can then kind of replicate the magic.    What I would do, where I would be curious to like kick the tires on would be, is like, can you build an internal system that you could take a, you know, a good storyteller person that wants to be basically one of your, let's call them kind of coaches or I don't know.    And basically run them through that thing.    And it's the carbon copy of you.    And it can assess like, no, you're not quite to me yet.    Like how much can you, not for founders to engage with, but for your internal people to get your osmosis.\n  00:24:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    So really you're talking about kind of more of the like certification type pathway and sort of credentialing and like really addressing supply side of like so many people who want to be doing work around story and messaging and positioning and all this kind of stuff.    But they don't, they don't have the advanced heuristics and understanding of what I've done, you know, in sort of these use cases in like, you know, big tech and corporate and being able to then use my storied AI as their tool, as well as then, you know, all the other parts that are part of just being a, you know, a trusted advisor.\n  00:24:56 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      That's where I would go to.    And honestly, they're going to have, they can't just be.    They're going to have to learn to tell their own story, their relevant experience.    But the more that you can just make that precious and you can protect the high touch, that's what I think where the demand is.    The demand is like, I want accessible high touch experience.    So you can't lose sight of that.\n  00:25:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You've got to protect that.\n  00:25:25 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      So that's going to be four-star.    And then I would build credentialing AI kind of around it to get there.    Versus like, we're going to go mass market.    We're going to try to replicate myself.    And you're going to be able to do this six-week course and kind of engage with me.    Suddenly the high touch magic is lost.    And that's what people want, I think.    I appreciate that.\n  00:25:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Part of my R&D cycle on this latest gen was two years ago, I went really big on maven.com and was like a top 50 course there and was running cohorts.    And that was one of the ways that I just first.    Further reinforce codifying all of my methods and frameworks.    And, you know, I had amazing CSAT scores of the value that people were getting.    But the business model, like when you're in online education, what people don't realize, you're not in the education business, right?    You're not in the transformation business.    You're in the digital marketing traffic and conversion business.    And I was just like, you know, that's not the business I wanted to be in then.    And it just takes such a massive funnel for doing that or, you know, building that flywheel.    And my gift has always been more B2B of just like, let me work with people who are in charge that are doing really big things.    And they immediately get the value and be able to put it to work.\n  00:26:48 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      And those aren't the people who then want to take a course.\n  00:26:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, right, like they want that one-on-one counsel, you know, or them and their, you know, their executive leadership team type of.    they that one they want    More trust, you know, brain trust work.\n  00:27:01 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      And I'm preaching to the choir here, but just in hearing what you just said, I can tell you get energy from the latter.\n  00:27:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      From which?    From the high touch, like working with kind of executives that get it.\n  00:27:12 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Like, it doesn't sound like the coursework gives you energy.    No, you know what?\n  00:27:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I love, I'm a teacher.    I love to teach.\n  00:27:18 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      So I enjoyed that.\n  00:27:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What I didn't like, though, was the production machine and the staffing that was required for running all the courses much worse than the stack and the capital required for the marketing.    It was all of that because it's really more, it's the difference between B2C versus B2B, right?    Like B2C, it's like selling falafels, right?    It's like lower margin.    You just need to like, you need to get people in the door and you need a lot of them.    And it's just, you know, and there are very few people who've been able to cross the chasm in online education that have been like thought leader creators who did, you know, who got to like one, two, three million dollars.    And then we're like, ah, this is a beast of a.    Because of the way the attention economy works, and how do you keep feeding the funnel with new people?    And it dilutes versus like, I keep moving up the value chain.    And I like working with those who are in the most influential systems and platforms, where it's like, they understand the leverage, and I can unlock the leverage very quickly.\n  00:28:21 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Yeah, that makes sense.\n  00:28:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Thank you.\n  00:28:24 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I appreciate that.\n  00:28:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is just helpful for me, I feel like, you know, it just gives me a better sense of resource I can point founders to.\n  00:28:31 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      And then obviously, I think, I think you're really smart to be selective on your side and be like, hey, you know what, maybe, maybe you're not the right type kind of ethos person that I can like, meld with.    I think it's, I really, I always respect service providers that know when to say no.    Like, it builds a credibility of like, okay, like, I know who I serve, and I know I don't.\n  00:28:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I'll tell you, it's interesting for me, in general, I find 90% of the time people people.    self-select in or self-select out from the beginning.    So I rarely get incoming or introductions to people that I'm like, okay, this is really not going to work, but I'm quick to kind of identify it and name it.    And it's usually someone that's just like, can't empty the cup.    That's just like so hardheaded and attached to like, I've got all the answers.    I figured it out.    Or like, they're just, they're so reductive that I'm like, is there any room to mold the clay?    Like, is there, you know, like any kind of emergent mindset?    That's really the biggest thing I'm screening for.    And then lastly is I have to also, I have to believe in the story, right?    If I don't believe in it, how can I expect anybody else to?    And that's true then for the founder as well.    So there's that piece of it too.    But yeah, people tend, there tends to be a gravitational orbit.    So I know we're in time.    What time?    What's the best way for us to stay connected, do you think?\n  00:30:04 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I mean, I would love to connect you with this founder because he needs to be a better storyteller.    As you were saying this, you know, around like, is there Clayton Mold?    It's a good, I like the image.    There is, he's good, but I don't know.    I actually, I would love to connect you with him and I wouldn't be surprised if you come back to me and you're like, I don't know.    I don't know if this guy like is like moldable.\n  00:30:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think, I think he is.\n  00:30:35 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      I think he is, but he's, he's been through a lot and a cleanup and he's kind of a new, like, so he was like a, an executive that's stepping in as the CEO.    And he's, he's like, that process has been a little hairy for him.    And the business is kind of doing some pivots, you know, it's a, anyway, there's a lot I could share on the business, but he's been through some more times.    And I think he, he, he's become a bit of a wartime.\n  00:31:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Got it.\n  00:31:01 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      And so he's just like, I, I, this has got to work.    And so he's, you I'd just be curious to have him engage with him.\n  00:31:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, I have, I have no problem working with really hard charging folks that like we're climbing and we're taking the  mountain.    Like, I love that, you know, and I love the velocity of, of hyper growth.    So that part's fine.    I'm happy to take the meeting and, and yeah, and just see, see if there's a potential fit.\n  00:31:28 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Cool.    Okay.    Well, it's good to connect.    then, yeah, there's other people I'm sure I'll cross paths with that could be a fit, but I think that's where my, my first kind of thought goes to.\n  00:31:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Awesome.    Send me your, your, your snail mail address and I'll put a few copies of my latest book in the mail to you guys.    I think you might enjoy it.    And is it cool if I, should I put two copies, three copies?\n  00:31:53 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Who else is in the office with you?    There's two of us in this office and we got a bunch in Salt Lake.    Two, two copies is great.\n  00:31:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Two copies.    copies.    Cool.    All right.    Who do I make out the other one to?\n  00:32:03 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Dalton Wright.    Dalton is kind of my partner here.\n  00:32:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    Matt and Dalton.    You got it.    Okay.\n  00:32:12 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      Awesome.\n  00:32:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      was good connecting, Matt.\n  00:32:13 - Matt Smith (kickstart.com)\n      We'll see you.    Talk soon.\n  00:32:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Bye.\n",
