Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_summary": "Meeting Purpose\n\nSync on weekly priorities, key deals, and operational tasks.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  - Veridical Ventures Deal Finalized: Michael will become an Operating Partner for Narrative, a first-of-its-kind role in VC. This creates a direct pipeline to Veridical's 5+ portfolio companies (portcos) and validates Storied's model.\n  - Q1 Capacity Planning is Critical: With a hard cap of 8 client sessions/week, Michael must manage an abundance of new opportunities (Veridical portcos, Kickstart, Excel KKR) against existing renewals. The goal is to create a waitlist and simplify offerings.\n  - Narrative Architect Hiring is a Top Priority: The Monday.com board is the central hub for managing the 71+ applicants. The focus is on targeted outreach, testing LinkedIn ad strategies, and using a \"GP-style\" swipe file for soft rejections to preserve relationships.\n  - Advent Health Texas Project is Time-Sensitive: A tight timeline requires Michael to provide intake questions today (Nov 17) so Edward can update the Typeform and get discovery docs by tomorrow (Nov 18). This enables analysis and delivery by Wednesday.\n\nTopics\n\nQ1 Capacity & Renewal Strategy\n\n  - Problem: Abundant new opportunities create a capacity crunch against a hard limit of 8 client sessions/week.\n  - Goal: Simplify offerings to improve forecasting and create a waitlist, moving away from complex, long-term contracts.\n  - Potential Solution: A standardized 3-month, weekly engagement model (e.g., $11k–$12k/mo), allowing for a high-velocity client portfolio.\n  - Key Pipeline:\n      - Veridical Ventures: 1-2 portcos (3-month, weekly, $12k/mo).\n      - WPS Cognitive Test: High-priority follow-up needed with Linda Girardi to define scope; potential 3-month, weekly engagement at $11k/mo.\n      - Relevant Partners: High intent; final SOW call needed to settle on scope and pricing (est. $6.5k/mo for bi-weekly).\n      - Kickstart Ventures: Inbound lead for a portco.\n      - Excel KKR: Keynote to 30-40 portcos.\n  - Renewals:\n      - DNA Stack: 6-month renewal secured.\n      - Straddle: Likely renewal as a Veridical portco.\n      - ACLM: Rate increase needed.\n      - Salesforce: Renewal uncertain; contact may move to a new company.\n\nNarrative Architect Hiring\n\n  - Status: 71+ applicants tracked on the Monday.com board.\n  - Goal: Reach 100 applicants by month-end.\n  - Recruitment Sources & Strategy:\n      - MetaView: Edward to identify candidates → send connection invites with job link.\n      - Upwork: Edward to harvest promising profiles.\n      - LinkedIn Ads: Test two strategies:\n          - Promoted job post (Edward to manage).\n          - Boosted personal post (Edward to manage via Michael's account).\n          - Goal: Track performance to compare ROI.\n      - LinkedIn Profile: Edward to research how to add an \"Open to Work\" badge.\n  - Candidate Management:\n      - Soft Rejections: Michael will personally message overqualified candidates to preserve relationships, using a \"GP-style\" swipe file (concise, flattering, leaves door open).\n      - Monday.com Updates: Edward to add columns for \"Overqualified\" status, \"Personal Note Sent\" tracking, and \"Why Interesting\" notes.\n\nStoried AI Strategy & IP\n\n  - Strategic Shift: From \"Storied GPT\" to \"Storied AI.\"\n      - Rationale: The value is in Storied's custom algorithm, not the underlying LLM.\n      - Long-Term Goal (12-18 mos): Develop a self-hosted model with a \"mothership\" vector database and MCP protocol for model agnosticism.\n  - IP Protection:\n      - Domain: StoriedAI.com is owned; Storied.ai is not.\n      - Trademark: Register \"Storied AI\" under software (Class 42) → then challenge competitor \"StoryPath.\"\n\nAdmin & Logistics\n\n  - Mexico City Trip (Dec 28–Jan 1):\n      - Task: Research and present dining options for an anniversary trip.\n      - Priority 1 (Anniversary Dinner): Check availability for Pujol, Quintonil, and Contramar.\n      - Priority 2 (New Year's Dinner): Check availability for Pujol, Quintonil, and Contramar.\n      - Priority 3 (Lunches): Check availability for Pujol and Quintonil on Dec 29/30.\n      - Details: Staying at Sofitel Reforma.\n  - Hyundai Car Servicing:\n      - Task: Schedule servicing for the leased car.\n      - Questions for Dealer: Is service covered by lease?

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:00 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      By the way, I am feeling good.    I'm doing well.\n  00:00:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    You're feeling better from the cold that you had or the bug that wasn't going away for a while.\n  00:00:13 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    I think I think it's much better.    It's much better.\n  00:00:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Good.    Good.    I think you gave it to my kids, though.\n  00:00:25 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.\n  00:00:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      My kids and wife all have it.\n  00:00:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm holding up so far.\n  00:00:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    I'm taking my vitamins.\n  00:00:36 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yep.    Yep.    Amazing.\n  00:00:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      How was your weekend?\n  00:00:48 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Had a good weekend.    Had a good weekend.    Um, on Saturday I was invited, uh, for a community session.    when, uh, so it's...    Thank    It's a community outreach session talking about mental health, so just doing that as part of the Lions Club, so that went well, and then on Sunday I was just thinking that was interesting, nothing much, and yeah.\n  00:01:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What is the conversation around mental health like in Kenya?\n  00:01:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, so it's all about encouraging people to open up more.    think we, I think as a society, we're a bit more closed off.    People are hesitant to talk about their issues or disclose what they're going through their personal life.    So that's the first thing.    And the second thing was about meditating and taking, like, when you're feeling...    I'm overwhelmed, you know, put on the sort of like the white noise and then relax, try to, you know, calm yourself.\n  00:02:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I love, I love all of that.    That's, there's a lot of wisdom in that.    And what, I'm curious, just kind of building on this for a moment, that the first piece around, you know, holding things inside, you know, as a cultural sort of trait, how have you found your experience at Storied in the context, you know, like I'm a talker, I like to share a lot.\n  00:02:47 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And I like to kind of draw people out and, you know, getting you to share and other people to share.    What's, what's that like for you?    Yeah, it's a, I think it's a new experience.    So sort of like, because especially in most workplaces in Kenya, unless you're talking to a friend or someone who you interact with a lot more often, you don't share your personal life.    Or like when you come into work and you're meeting with your boss, it's just work stuff.    Yeah.    So just the experience of bringing your personal life into work has also sort of like given me this other perspective that, you know, it's okay.    It's okay to do it, I guess.\n  00:03:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    Right on.    Very cool.    Thank you for sharing that.\n  00:03:39 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Indeed.    Indeed.    What was your weekend?\n  00:03:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Weekend was good.    I mean, the kids were starting to feel a little sick and we had a lot of rain.    So it was kind of a pretty quiet weekend here at home, but overall good.    And the Rams.\n  00:04:00 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      We won on Sunday.\n  00:04:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It was a nail-biter of a game down to the last second, but we won.    So I was very happy about that, and so we're now in a really strong position for the Mollens.    So that was good.    And then I got the updated advisor agreement from Greg at Veridical.    And we got a deal.    So it's coming together, so I feel very good about that.\n  00:04:34 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm just having legal counsel review it, just kind of do a final review on it all.\n  00:04:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But that is good to go.    So that's going to – I have a really strong both intuition and conviction that that role in affiliation is going to be a force multiplier for us at Storied in 2021.    Yeah, and it takes the thesis of our work, and it frames it and positions it with even more leverage, even more, like, pull versus push.\n  00:05:24 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah.\n  00:05:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    Like, I think we're, I think by the middle of next year, we are going to be oversubscribed in terms of client base with waitlist.    And, you know, it's just going to be a good problem to have.    But I'm already, I mean, even as I'm, like, mapping things for Q1, I'm like, who are we saying yes to?    Who do I need to say no to?    Where do I need to position our rates?    Because we're going to hit max utilization for me.\n  00:05:59 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:05:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    And it's going to take a few months to ramp up the narrative analyst.    And then even with them, like, there's still things we have to test and prove out of how much more bandwidth does it open up.\n  00:06:13 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah.\n  00:06:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And, you know, I mean, the business is just on a really good track, but I want to have time and space to be able to, like, write the next book and, you know, and, like, work on storied AI, like, keep building the ontology and the tool, you know, the frameworks, sort of how we codify things.    All of those things, you know, require focus and discipline around time.\n  00:06:43 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Okay.    Okay.    And if I remember correctly, the role was going to, the operating partner role, he's going to introduce you to.    Companies within the venture fund for Sprint?\n  00:07:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, so there are currently five portfolio companies or what are called portcos.    So there's five portcos in the fund.    We're already working with one of them.\n  00:07:17 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      That's Straddle.\n  00:07:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, so there's four more.    But then also know that they're placing four to six investments every year.    So there's going to be another four to six that go into the portfolio in 2026.\n  00:07:34 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:07:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    And every year, there'll be at least four to six.    And then within the next year and a half or two years, if things are going well, then we raise fund two.    And then three years after that, fund three.    You end up stacking or layering the funds.    And each fund.    And with it, also it means placing more investments.\n  00:08:09 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Okay.\n  00:08:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Amazing.    Amazing.\n  00:08:12 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And I also think the outreach by Kickstart is also a validation of, you know, how well the work is going.    I think straddle has been quite impactful as well.\n  00:08:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's exactly right.\n  00:08:36 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:08:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I expect a lot more of that to be happening.\n  00:08:42 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:08:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But yes, Kickstart has a portfolio company that they want us to work with.    Also know that my keynote with Excel KKR.    They...    So...    So...    So...    Excel, so Excel KKR is a joint venture between a tier one venture capital firm that's one of the like top 10 tier one, like they're, you they're one of the top 10 firms from the 90s and from the 2000s, but big, big pedigree.    And then KKR is considered the number one or top three private equity firm in the world.    Right, or at least, again, one of the big dogs.    So yeah, that keynote and affiliation is also a really big moment.\n  00:09:36 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And, and I'm going to be in front of 30 or 40 of their portfolio companies.    Yeah.    It's gonna rain.    Yeah, it's gonna rain.\n  00:09:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, so but you know, step by step, we gotta, you know, we have to stay humble.    It's day one.    Like we gotta be really dis.    Discipline.    So I'm just continuing to like, what are the foundational things that we put in place?    And it's going to be okay to say no to things.    And we're going to be saying no to lots of things.\n  00:10:10 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Or we're going to be saying maybe, but not yet to a lot of things.    Yeah.\n  00:10:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.    But you helping me be a gatekeeper, managing my time, us getting really disciplined about what we're doing and all the things that we're not doing is going to be critical.    Yeah.    Last piece on this.    So me becoming not only an operating partner for Veridical Ventures, but operating partner for Narrative, that is a first across the venture capital world.\n  00:10:45 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Hmm.\n  00:10:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So there, there are some VC firms that have a operating partner for like brand marketing for some go-to-market things for con.    There's even one that they have someone for storytelling.    But there's no firm that has narrative.    And that is going to be the thing that, and there's a whole thesis around it that I have, and I've been sharing with Greg, and he's really bought into as well.    That thesis is going to have a lot of pull.    It's to have a lot of pull.    So, yeah.\n  00:11:32 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Sounds exciting.    Sounds exciting.    think it's a breaking new ground.\n  00:11:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:11:41 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      new ground.    We are.    We are.\n  00:11:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We are.    So, let's talk about this week.    Oh, and before we do, Edward, I just want you to know, like, you know.    don't know.    Uh, you have made a meaningful difference in contribution on this journey.    Like what we've been doing together in terms of setting up systems, workflows, processes.    This has always been my Achilles heel.    Yeah.    Right.    Because remember, I've been doing this work for 20 years.    That's why I'm so good at the like, oh, yeah, put me in.    And I can solve any Rubik's Cube, like hard thing at a narrative level.    But the like, how do we break things down into workflows and processes and things that are repeatable and scalable?    That's my adaptive capacity.    I have to really muscle my way through that.    And what we've done to really create these routines and these like our focus and just our partnership.    Like you, I just want you to know, I recognize and see you and that the.    And you know, know, know, know, know,    We have a lot to build on for 2026.    A lot to build on.    Yeah.    And on that note, by the way, know that continuing to package and codify storied AI in the medium to long term is going to be another growth lever.\n  00:13:32 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Hmm.\n  00:13:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      OK.    And and I've already started, by the way, I want you to notice something.    I'm moving away from saying storied GPT.    And I'm moving towards saying storied AI.    Because what matters is actually the algorithm.    Basically, it's our it's our custom model.    That based on our training data, based on our.    System prompt, based on all of that, that that's where the value is.    And it sits outside of any of the individual models, whether that's open AI, I-clawed, perplexity, grok, you name it.    It just so happens that our first go-to-market version of it is a storied GPT, because that's the lowest friction way that we're making it available for people that we work with.\n  00:14:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:14:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    But storied AI is above that, which is why us building in a way where we're more in control, where we can basically actually, part of the desired state, for instance, is going to be in, say, like, 12 to 18 months from now, where storied AI actually is our own custom model.    That right?    right?    Runs on our local drives.    That's when we really actually own the IP of this thing, and we have an MCP-like protocol that allows us to work with any of the different models.    Could be, you know, Meta's Llama, it could be, you know, Claude, could be OpenAI, you name it.    But we own the mothership, we own the Vector Database, and we have the MCP protocols for it.\n  00:15:28 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, yes.    It's the goal.    Yeah, and that's interesting, because I think recently I saw someone saying, okay, I don't know if you're talking about, like, self-hosted LLM.\n  00:15:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:15:45 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      But I saw that they are really good models coming out that are local to your context.\n  00:15:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So, yeah.    That's exactly right.    That is, that's where we need to go towards.\n  00:15:59 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's get started.\n  00:16:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It might take us a year, might take us 18 months, but yes, that's part of the promised land.    That's when we really are in control, and it will also use less compute and less tokens.\n  00:16:11 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, yes.\n  00:16:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And it's a more scalable architecture.\n  00:16:18 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, without dependency on any one model.    Yeah.    Sounds good.    Sounds good.    All right.    One thing to note, actually, just because you mentioned Storied AI, Storied.ai is a used domain.\n  00:16:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So I'm just like...    But what we do have, we do own StoriedAI.com.    Okay.\n  00:16:51 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Double check for me, but I'm pretty sure we do.\n  00:16:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    I believe that's the one we own.\n  00:16:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    I'll look into that.\n  00:16:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And what I need to do is I need...    I need to work with our IP attorney.    One of the next trademarks we need to register is going to be for storied AI, basically, or rather storied for the class 42 software category.\n  00:17:16 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:17:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That was competing against us.    I got them to abandon their mark.    And then there is also these guys, which we're going to have to, once we register storied    I need to go after these guys, which where are they?    There you go.    These guys.    All right.    So I definitely am going to have to go and defend this, but it's okay.    First, I need to go and just squat.\n  00:18:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      like go and basically secure our IP.    Is this a competitor for Storypad?\n  00:18:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      No.    Well, if you were thinking at a really, really generic, broad level, sure.    But in reality, no.    What StoryPath is really focusing in on are the very specific needs of...    You could say what this is, is basically like Gamma.ai, but with a...    With a story angle to it, it's sort of the, okay.    But what StoryPath is doing is specifically for enterprise go-to-market teams.    So sales and marketing teams inside big companies, the more complex the product, the better.    So big, complex stuff.    People at Oracle and at Cisco and at Roche are like people who've got really big, complex stuff that's hard to explain and how to manage your sales process through better storytelling and pitch presentations, but really building for the workflows.    So, all right.    Cool.    Anyways, I love you asking all these questions.    This is exactly the kind of thing that I love hearing from you.    Okay, let's go to, let's go to our board.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay, so key, okay, annual, so November priorities, annual renewal pitch.    We'll come back to that.    Key deals, so DNA stack is done.    Veritical is, we're basically, we're good to go.    We're just on the legal phase at this point.    So that is good to go.    And then relevant, I had a call with him on Friday.    Quick call.    He has clear intent of wanting to move forward.    We just need to actually schedule a 30 minute final.    So with him and settle on pricing.    I'm to walk him through the SOW, settle in scope and pricing.    Will you put on your follow-up list to basically send him a short email and CC me about scheduling with him this week?    I'll do that.    Great.    All right.    And then narrative architect role, five to 10 top candidates.    I love the progress that we're making there.\n  00:21:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm further in a little bit.\n  00:21:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Although actually what I realized is I don't think we have, do we have this narrative architect role anywhere else?    I don't think we do.    So let me put this here.    Narrative architect role.    Okay.    And this is the kind of stuff I would love for you to be.    Justcoricy.    Type    Managing or have that awareness of.\n  00:22:04 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      So let me ask you to fill out the rest of those for narrative architect role, okay?    Yes.    Okay.    We have, like, action items.\n  00:22:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, I see.\n  00:22:15 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      They're up here.    Under the narrative analysis workflow pertaining to that.\n  00:22:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Ah, okay.    Got it.    Okay.    And then I see some up here as well.    Okay.    All right, tell you what, let's actually click down into this one, since this is such a big and significant one.    So tell me about, or give me kind of TLDR high level summary, and then what you see as next indicated actions for both you and I this week.\n  00:22:56 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    So.    Highlights.    think we have, I believe last I checked was 71 applicants.    So yeah, I think what I am hoping for is that we can get 100 candidates by the end of the month.    And I think that gives us a nice wide range of people to choose from.    And so on the spreadsheet, you had some kind of like colour labelling.    So I just transferred that over here.    I'm not sure if the labels are exactly what you meant, but you can always update that.    And as well as if you scroll to the right, there's that column that says application details.    So you have like that single view.\n  00:24:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      For updates to scroll to.    How do I, oh, I see it and go like this.    Yeah.    Okay.    Great.\n  00:24:09 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:24:09 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is really well done, Edward, for kind of quick and dirty, like, getting this into a Monday working flow, right, and making good enough, like, you know, perfection being the enemy of good enough.    I'm really happy with, um, with CNIS, so the, um, okay, so let me, okay, so sorry, keep going.    So what do you see as, like, next steps, and then I'll give you some of my thoughts or commentary.\n  00:24:47 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, so next steps, um, MetaView, I think we can, I can run another.    The prompt and see, maybe you can generate.    Maybe    I mean, the last time we got eight, I think they proposed maybe around 30 or more.    So yeah, hopefully we can get another eight to 10.    I can also look at App Work profiles.    I think we can also get maybe five to 10 there as well.    The other thing we can do to sort of promote the reach is do another list.    It was, I think we just need one to get to maybe 90 or 100 people.\n  00:25:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    So a couple questions or comments on each of these.    So this is great.    I love your thinking.    I fully support all of it.    MetaView, once you identify short stack candidates, what is the workflow?    You reach out to them.    You share the job post and see if they apply.\n  00:25:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Is that sort of the workflow?    Yeah.    I what we can do is, because we have the LinkedIn profiles, we have to send a connection, invite, then have like a short snippet that says, I have this role that I'm hiring for, I'm interested, and then just give them the type form.    Okay.\n  00:26:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's what I would propose.    All right.    So, okay, so you own that.    You'll continue to identify candidates in MetaView and send those out.    Then the second one was Upwork.    Oh, so one thing we should do is, do we have a column in here that labels the recruiting source?    As in, did it come from LinkedIn, MetaView, or Upwork?\n  00:26:49 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    There should be a column that says origin.\n  00:26:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I don't see it unless I'm missing.\n  00:26:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Let me scroll here.\n  00:26:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Ah, there we go.    Got it.    Okay.    Wonderful.    Okay.    All right.    Fantastic.    Cool.    And then, so yeah, definitely Harvest.    There were, seemed like a few candidates in Upwork that were working, right?    Yeah.    Yeah.    So let's, let's pull those in and then LinkedIn.    So based on what we're seeing so far, I see.    And then there are some Upwork ones.    Good.    What, based on what I'm seeing so far, I think doing a little bit more broadcasting and advertising on LinkedIn is a good thing.    Let me ask you this.    How much have we spent so far in what period of time on LinkedIn?\n  00:27:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Ballpark.    Ballpark.    We just spent $200.    It pays off.    So I set it to $200, and then it ran for, I believe, four days.\n  00:28:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It was paused on Friday.    Okay.    Yeah.    And was that just the ad for the job, or was that a boosted post of my post?\n  00:28:26 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Just an ad for the job.\n  00:28:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.\n  00:28:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's play with both.\n  00:28:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Okay.    Let's see.    And do you know, do you have access to be able to do the boosted post?    You can log into my account and be able to do it from here, right?\n  00:28:47 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Like up here, boost?\n  00:28:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Great.    And something I would love, if it's not too complicated, is see if then there's a way for us to...    to track the data, to better understand how each of those two perform against each other, of just promoting the job versus a boosted post.    Yeah, yeah.    One other thing, too, that I'd love for you to help me figure out was, how do I, oh, I think it's here.    Open to, I wanted to be able to add, you know, how do I, there used to be a thing where I could simply add a little badge, you know, that would like wrap around my photo that says I'm hiring.\n  00:29:45 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, yeah.\n  00:29:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, here we go.    Share that you're hiring.    Is this it?\n  00:29:52 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, so it's taking me to the screen here.    Yeah, I don't, I don't understand.\n  00:30:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So see if you can figure that out, or if there's a way to how we link the current job posts so that I further signal to people that we're hiring.\n  00:30:09 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:30:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    Okay.    So I love all of this.    One other thing on here is, so one of the things I want to be sensitive to is there are, so.    So, so one of the things, especially now that we're moving into.    So as I become an operating partner of this fund.    I am going to start changing the syntax of how I communicate to people.    There's a subtle art to this.    So the subtle art, especially, I want to model talking like a general partner of a venture fund.    Okay.    Which is the one who's the real, really in charge.    So a general partner of a venture fund speaks like this.    Super concise.    Is quick to, like, say something that flatters the other person.    Okay.    While at the same time, don't over explain anything.    Set really clear boundaries.    Like, kind of like, you know, you know, thanks so much for this.    You know, love what you're up to.    I'm heads down at the moment.    Like, like, be clear about what is or isn't a fit.    But always then leave the door open for optionality.    So it's the, it's basically the art of saying no, that makes other people feel good.\n  00:31:57 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:31:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    And.    I'm starting to practice it.    I will coach you and mentor and onboard you into how to do this as well.    I bring this up because there's a bunch of people who've applied, who are overqualified, and or other people that I know I have a personal relationship with, and I'm like, they're not a fit for this.    So how do I say no, but in a way that doesn't feel like a rejection?    So what I want and need us to do, I need another column, and I need this column to be basically like something to track me sending a personal quick message to each of them.    Okay.    And we can build a swipe file so that it can be like, you know, rinse and repeat.    Doesn't have to be complicated.    But, like, I need to send for some people, this can't just be, you know, like, you know, you and story communicating to them.    For me to manage or preserve the relationship, I need to send people short loan notes.    Yes.    Okay?    And so I need a way to both track who are the people that need that.    And two, then I need a way to track whether we've sent the note or not.\n  00:33:27 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.\n  00:33:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    And let me give you an example.\n  00:33:32 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      So, like, Rahul Abinyakar.\n  00:33:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay?    So he's someone I've known for a while.    He sent me an email about it.    And so this is how I responded.    Hi, Rahul.    Thanks for throwing your hat in.    The role scoped as an analyst see more of an apprenticeship lane right now.    You're clearly operating at a different pace.    Altitude.    Let's keep the door open for future ways to work together when the fit's bigger.    And so it's stuff like that.    And then he wrote back this and blah, blah, blah.    And like, hey, I couldn't.    I just wrote back.    Look, the comp reflects three to five years experience.    It's really early mid-career role.    I need someone to drop right and be able to own their lane and workflows.    Let's keep in touch as things evolve in progress.    Okay?    Like, I'm being really focused and clear, no distractions, right?    It's like, you know, or like, let me give you another example of this.    You know, this guy was referred by someone who I really like and respect.    This guy's doing interesting stuff, but he's a senior VP at this other firm, blah, blah, blah.    All right.    right.    Hey, love Jay.    This is the person who introduced us.    Love your background.    The role scope is an analyst seat.    More of an apprenticeship lane right now.\n  00:35:09 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      You're clearly operating at a different altitude.\n  00:35:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's keep the door open for future conversations.    Okay?    See, this is like talking like a GP, right?    I'm saying something positive about them.    I'm being really defined in what is or isn't relevant.\n  00:35:25 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And I'm keeping the door open.\n  00:35:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So then he was like, oh, yeah, absolutely.    Thanks.    Blah, blah, blah.    Hey, if you're up for it, to pick your brain.    How do I reply back?    Really direct.    Heads down at the moment.\n  00:35:41 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Re-seek in six months.    Right?\n  00:35:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Very few filler words.    I'm very direct.    I'm just being really clear about this is what's important to me and what's not.    But keeping the door open.\n  00:35:54 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Yes.    I think...    I think that all makes sense.    I mean, especially, like, the part about, like, QR, letting them know that, you know, their capability is much higher than what their role requires.\n  00:36:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's a way to make them feel good.    I still don't know that they're a fit that I'd want to work with, but it's the perfect soft rejection.\n  00:36:27 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Right?\n  00:36:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    I don't need to say, like, no, this isn't going to work.    It's just like, this just doesn't fit the scope of the role, you know, like, this wouldn't be right for you, you know, but in a way that's, like, speaks to their ego and their own self-esteem.\n  00:36:47 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Indeed.\n  00:36:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay?\n  00:36:50 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      You're going to start to see me do this all over the place with how I communicate to people, especially when I say no.    Yep.\n  00:36:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.\n  00:36:58 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.\n  00:36:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Easy.    Um...    All right, so what I do want you to do is this is a good swipe copy for recruiting, like some version of this.    All right.    Okay, I would kind of go...    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    All right.    So, okay, cool.    Let's go back to recruiting.    Let's add another label called overqualified, because there's a bunch of people.\n  00:38:42 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      That's another way that we'll put this on status.\n  00:38:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    And then...    Good night.    Thank you.    Thank you.    And then I want to move this closer.    Okay, so this is like, as opposed to a decision, I want it, what makes them interesting?    Okay, and that way we can kind of like come up with a short little one sentence about like, what are the reasons why they're in consideration, right?    Yeah, yeah.    Okay.    Sweet.    Okay, I think I've named everything needed.    Is there anything else on this record?    Recruiting.    Great job, Edward.\n  00:40:04 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I'm really, really happy with what you're doing here.\n  00:40:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so it sounds like for the moment, we're going to wait.    We're not going to try to onboard, say, Workable or some other candidate pipeline.    We're going to try to just use this for the moment.    Is that sort of the thought?    Yeah.    Okay.    I'm cool with that.    All right.    Cool.\n  00:40:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Are these all up to date, these percentages of completion?    I don't think so.\n  00:40:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let me update that.\n  00:40:39 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:40:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Great.    All right.    Let's go to annual renewals.    So the thing that my challenge right now is    Is, I have this dilemma around how many clients, but basically it has to do with pricing and scope of how many of my frequency of meetings, because my max utilization for QB, Q1 is 16, either six, basically 16, well, I'll put it to this way.    My max utilization for Q1 is eight client sessions per week, right?    Eight client sessions per week.    So that would be 16 if we're meeting biweekly, or it's eight if we're meeting weekly.    Yeah.    Okay.    So that's how I have to think about this of like, we've got fixed capacity.    He can only work with 16.    So then the question becomes like, what's the right 16 mix?    Yeah, or eight mix, yeah.\n  00:42:10 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And, I mean, Dnistar takes two of those.    Correct, correct, correct.\n  00:42:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's exactly right.    So I started mapping this out.    And, okay, so we have WPS and my work with Jeff Manson.    I need to negotiate up, but, you he's been a longstanding client for 20 years.\n  00:42:40 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I got to figure out a way to make that work.\n  00:42:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We'll figure it out, okay?    And then I have OMD that's also like grandfathered in here because of sort of this equity deal.    So I kind of need to, like, consider both of these as just kind of built in.    It's going to...    to include one due diligence call a month and one strategy session with Greg a month.    So that basically also needs to be considered and take up a slot.    Yeah.    Okay.    So that right there is three slots.    Yeah.    Then I have DNA stack for six months and they're taking up two slots.    I have WPS cognitive test, which I need.    That's the other one I need you to reach out to to follow up with Linda to work in 30 minutes with her because I really need to get a sense as to the scope of that.    But I suspect that this is going to be three months.    And if we're meeting, you know, if we're meeting weekly, then it'll be 11.    And if we're meeting biweekly, then.    We'll be a little, you know, we'll be like 6,500 or 7,500 or something like that, okay?    But I'm right now taking the high side to just, like, be really sober, okay?    Then I've got, that's the final go, no-go, and if it is a go, that's weekly, four or three months at 11,000 a month.    So that's already, like, you know, been discussed as on paper.    Okay, then I've got the next portfolio company of Veridical, and I've spoken with Greg about this, of the idea of doing three months at 12,000 a month and doing weekly as a way to get through enough of the portfolio companies and at the right price point that works all around, and he agreed.    So we should have one of those.\n  00:44:57 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      There might even be two if we wanted, but there's at least one.    Yeah.\n  00:45:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then we've got Kickstart Ventures.    Obviously, I've to take the first call and further do due diligence there if it's a fit, but let's assume potentially they're coming in.    Okay.    Then I've got relevant partners.    And he's conveying intent.    So that's either six months.    That might go down to 6,500.    But basically, at a minimum, it'll be 6,500 for biweekly.\n  00:45:39 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.\n  00:45:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Possibly it ladders up to something like this.    Okay.    Same with Twitch.    So Twitch is in a renewal process.    And there's something really meaningful there I would love to go stall for.    Roche has a desire to keep working.\n  00:45:58 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      And so there's something there too.\n  00:46:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    So you can see this stuff stacks up fast.    I'm sort of sitting here going, and then we have Q4 end.    So Advent, Health, Monica, that's going to end in December.\n  00:46:15 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Milken will end in December.\n  00:46:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So that opens up some slots.    And then Q1 end, we have Straddle, ACLM, Salesforce, and French Flourist.    Okay.    Salesforce, if she stays at Salesforce, but she might take a SVP role at another startup.    And if she does, she wants to then bring us in.    But for now, I can take them off the board.    And then these guys, these guys are kind of on the fence about, like, I love working with them, but I don't know that they're, I mean.    Grattle, maybe.    Probably the most likely one because of the portco thing, but we might just do six months.    ACLM, I need to raise my rates, and I don't know how much they can afford.    French Florist, I'm heavily discounting my rate there, and they're a little bit different because they're not a pure tech company.    And then we've got things like this, Pipeline.    I've got AdventHealth Texas.    I've got Excel KKR.    I've got JLL.    Now you can see how my brain is like, okay, how do we...    So here's what I'm sitting with.    I don't have the answer to this yet, but like simple scales.    Complex doesn't.    So I need to figure out...    out a way to simplify all of this so that we can better forecast it and also have a better working model.    But I do think having a version that is three months at 11 or three months at 12 really does serve the business.    And for us to create, because I need to have a portion of my portion of the portfolio that needs to be moving.    Like I need to be able to like work with people, go put a dent, you know, in the universe and then have a wait list.\n  00:48:41 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      great.    We can't start immediately.    can start in 60 days.    I can start in 90 days.\n  00:48:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And like, we constantly have people working through.\n  00:48:48 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      That's much harder if I have everybody on six to 12 months.    Yeah.    Okay.    Okay.    I don't know.    I don't know exactly how we solve for that.    It's a bit...    I know.\n  00:49:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So the way that I want us to solve for it is, one, get me rescheduled with Tomas for this week.    Okay.    Let's work that in.    And then the other way, and I'll talk to also Jason about this.    on Friday.    And then what we may need to do, and I'll get Jason's input on this.    We may need to have a better way to track or distinguish which clients are singles versus doubles, right?    So that we always have a sense of, again, sort of this...\n  00:49:58 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Maxcapacitization, right?\n  00:50:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Anyways, I just want to give you visibility.    That's the big thing I kind of have to figure out right now.    The good news is we have an abundance of opportunity and riches.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay, we talked about DNA-relevant veridical, LinkedIn workflows.    Okay, that's in the slow lane.    Narrative analysis workflows in the slow lane.    Oh, let's talk about this, though, as it relates to what we have to do with Advent Health Texas this week.    Yes.    Where is the...    Okay, this is the type form for intake?    Yes.    Okay, what I need to do is I am going to quickly update page, what you call page three.    Does it work?\n  00:51:34 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      When it says pages, meaning like they're screens?    Yeah, so the first screen is page one and then once you go to next, it's page two and so on.\n  00:51:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You may need to break up this what you call page three or screen three into a few and I need.\n  00:51:59 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.\n  00:52:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is the one section I need to customize a bit more, but this is probably the thing that's most, one of the things that's most at risk this week because of managing the timeline, right?    So what it means is basically what needs to happen is I need to get you the updated questions for the intake.    You need to quickly update that.    We approve it.    We send it to them.    And then we need to focus on getting the discovery docs from them today and then getting that intake filled out by early tomorrow.    So that I can then run the model realistically.    All right, I need to, it's going to be a tight day, but I basically need to run this during the day.    We finalize and ship out Wednesday for them reviewing on Friday.    But I need you, this is, so in addition to recruiting, this is one of the things I need your very strong accountability partnership.    Like ride on me.    If I don't, you know, when we finish our call, if you don't get within the hour from me, you know, that information, be like, Michael, where is it?    I need it.    Like, let's really drive hard because this thing is we've made a commitment and I don't want to drop    Drop the commitment, you know, or not deliver on it.    Okay.    Great.    Okay.    All right.    So that is that.    And then, what else do we need to check in on?    AI workflows.\n  00:54:30 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      What do we want to check in there?    For AI workflows, one of the questions that I have is, okay, maybe something to bring up with Jose.    I was just wondering about, he mentioned a built out workflow for newsletter to LinkedIn content, but I don't think I have.    Yeah.\n  00:55:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      He was supposed to get us a whole bunch of stuff by the end of the week last week and haven't heard from him.    So here, let me just quickly.    By the way, our newsletter, did you schedule it to go out on Sunday or leave it unscheduled?    I didn't actually send it yet.    forgot to just do my final proof.    It's on me.    It's all good.    Part of what I want to get done is I really would love to get those newsletters, like all figured out before Friday, for everybody's benefit, right?    So that they're just like, they're set and whatever else didn't see anything come through on Friday.    you recent or update us on progress?    Um, okay.    All right.    So at least pinged him.    Okay.    Um, got it.    Okay.    Story GPT rollout to clients.    The thing, the thing there is, got it.    So it's just the drive drug.    Client portal draft email.    I actually had edits on that during the plane ride that I can give you, because I think it would be great to just, let's freaking get this thing out to some of our key clients and some of our new ones that we get them onto Notion more than anything on the client portal.    Okay.    And it's a good signal as we go through.    Okay, but see, here's an example, by the way, here it says here, client portal final review.    But then there's nothing defined around it.\n  00:57:45 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, I was updating that earlier today.\n  00:57:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      was looking for something I wrote earlier.    Okay, great.    All right.    So...    But I'm kind of the attitude with the client portal.    Let's get the draft email approved.    Let me just glance at the client portal itself.    And let me let good enough not be the enemy of perfection.    Like, I just want to get this thing done.    So because here's what it's a really useful signal as we go into contract conversations or renewals for 2026.    It's one of the examples of how we're leveling up our infrastructure, our resources, our value, all of that.    Yes.    Yep.    Okay.    Cool.    So yeah, update that.    And then anything else?    Testimonials cleanup.    It's just sitting because of some of these other things.    And it's okay.    Like, we'll just let that continue to end.    Weekly Newsletter says to sync on, there, is that current?\n  00:59:09 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Is there something you want to check in there?    It was just around the off-flow's way, the postway.    Got it.    Understood.\n  00:59:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah, I need to give them a bunch of feedback, too, of what's working or what we need more of.    And, okay, let me give you a few other things that are some admin or things that I need support on.    So, quick question before you do.\n  00:59:38 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, yeah.    The Kawash person asked for feedback on if, like, basically, what your experience was this time compared to the things that you had raised up last time.\n  00:59:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, I have...    I haven't inspected the outside of the car closely.    I've been a bit more removed from it.    I'll go take a look.    I don't love the scheduling mishap.    And then also, I love to pay him.    He never sends me the amount.    Because I have him on Venmo, but a basic billing workflow is, hey, today's job is over.    The cost of today was X, and here's my Venmo.    Like, you know, like, why are you making this so easy for me?    Like, I don't know or remember what it is.    Like, it's just so, to be honest with you, I'm kind of at a place where I think we probably, well, find out how much it is.    Let me take a look.    I don't love some of this friction that's like, it's just hasn't been steady, consistent, reliable.    I'd call it a B instead of an A, but it's really hard to argue against the price.    So I can tell you, I know like other car wash services that come to your house for the level of detail that we're looking for.    It's really competitively priced.\n  01:01:29 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      So that's the trade off, but they're just less oiled of the machine.    So I might maybe keep tolerating the B grade for a while.\n  01:01:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's kind of my quick, my quick thought between that.    All right.    Okay.    So a couple other things.    So let me give you a sense of my week.    What I need to do do later.    This afternoon is I'm working on a bunch of client outputs using StoryGPT.    So the first thing I need to do is actually quickly clean up Milken based on my last client session so I can ship back to her two documents.    That won't take long.    Then I need to run DNA stack analysis for their investment pitch.    Then I need to go to Twitch and I need to take the last session I did with them and organize that into a strategy doc.    And then I've got Advent, Texas, and that, although we talked about we're not going to run that really till Tuesday.    But what I need to do...    Oh, I just realized I have a week, yeah?    Where, okay.    And then I had this climate hub, but I'm realizing I don't need that till a week from today.    So I've got a little bit of time there as well.    Okay, so then...    And...    And then when do I meet with ACL?    Not until after Thanksgiving.    Yeah, okay.    Let me see.    I've got a bunch of work I need to do there.    Okay.    Okay, so that's the client stuff, but know that this afternoon I'm going to come back with some instances that I need them to be formatted.    Great.    Okay.    Then on the sales side, you're going to prioritize getting relevant partners scheduled and getting WPS Linda Girardi scheduled.    Yes.    Okay.    I then need to follow up with Veritical on a one-page slide that he wants to add that describes me, so that's just on me.    I also need to send him a quick email giving him visibility on...    On the Quickstart Ventures outreach, because I don't want him to be surprised by that.    So I just want to give him visibility.    I need to follow up with JLL for the Intro to Story Path.    I already emailed him or messaged him.    So that's in the works.    And then annual renewals.    That's what you and I discussed.    And what I need to get input from Tomas and Jason on about kind of doing the math and figuring out who's in, who's not, and how to map that out.    That's kind of tied to pipeline analysis.    Okay, so that's all my sales stuff this week.    Then on the growth side, we've got the newsletter.    And I definitely need to review, because, you know, Hosway created like five or six newsletters for us.\n  01:05:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      There was actually only two that I could use.\n  01:05:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So there was the one that was two weeks ago, the one.    And I picked number 30 for this week.    The other ones I couldn't use.    And I need to give him feedback about why he's going too much into examples from our clients in a way that's too revealing.    So I need to give him some structural feedback.    We'll figure it out.    But so there's that.    And then being able to, like, carve up a newsletter into LinkedIn posts.    We need that from Hoseway.    I need to make a post about the Milken Institute and me being in D.C.    And so that's a separate LinkedIn post.    Recruiting Pipeline, you and I discussed, and you're moving on that.    Hoseway Feedback, I need to generate.    Let me build that in here.    All right.    And then on the Admin Front Client Portal, so Client Portal.    And then...    And then...    Okay, I've got legal and then I've got tax accounting stuff.    Okay, so here's a couple of admin things I need your support with.    So one I forwarded to you, it's BEAM benefits and paying.\n  01:07:59 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Thank you.    That monthly benefit and seeing if you can put it on auto-pay.\n  01:08:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And let me see.    Let me open.    Let me give you password access.    Okay.    So I think it's BeamBenefits.com is the one that's going to be for the main one.\n  01:08:40 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I think this is my personal.\n  01:08:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But let me share both with you in case you need it.    And then let me know which one.    That way I'll update it because then I can update this to like Beam Dental Personal or whatever.    So let me know.\n  01:08:58 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      But start, start.\n  01:09:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      with the bean benefits and see if that gets you in a bit.    Okay, so you've got that.    The next thing that I need help with is kerry.com.    I need you to research the following.    It's basically, what are the directions for Elle to create her own login or account that is tied to the GetStoried 401k trust, but for her to be able to set that up as the spouse and also as an employee of Storied.    Okay, so because they do only solo 401ks, but as part of a solo 401k, you can put your spouse on the plan if the spouse works in the business.    But I don't, I just need to know what are the directions for like what she needs to do in order to have her own account.    account that's then connected or tied to the GetStory trust.    And you might need to just open a support ticket for it.\n  01:10:06 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  01:10:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then whatever her directions are.    So that's that.    Okay, then my Hyundai, so our car needs to go in for servicing.    I am going to forward you.    I'm going to forward you.    Okay, so here, Edward.    Okay, so I'm forwarding this to you.    And so the question is, okay, to schedule servicing one as part of our lease.    I I do.    do.    I believe the service is no cost.    Please confirm.    Two, do we automatically have to get the car serviced at downtown L.A.    location where we bought car?    Or is Santa Monica location option?    Three, do they provide a loaner car for the day?    Or schedule it out on a Friday or Monday in December.    December, when my calendar isn't so over full.    All right, and then let me just check anything else on that.    So then, this is from Dylan Potter, the GM of a day downtown LA, who is a friend.    And if we need to call on.    him, but I'm not sure that we do.    I think you can go this other route to just get stuff figured out.    But that's just the backup.    Okay.    And it's basically, by the way, it's just state.    So if I have standard servicing, although the wheels are weather, although tires need to be checked.    It's occasionally slipping, sliding.    Okay.    Sweet.    All right.\n  01:13:45 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      I think that gives you the context that you need.\n  01:13:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    And then one more thing is Mexico City.\n  01:14:03 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      There's the vacation in December.\n  01:14:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, we're going to go December 28th through January 5th, I think.    Yeah.    So the 28th.    Let actually mark this.    Oh, actually, sorry, January 28th through the 2nd.    Mexico.    Or actually, is it through the 1st?    28, 29, 30, 31.    Okay, so it's actually January 28th through the 1st is what it is.    We're just getting away for four nights.    All right.    So.    All right.    And then my mother-in-law is going to come and visit and stay with us in between.    So she'll give us some child care.    So the thing, so here's what I need some help with is, okay, so anniversary meal on the 28th for dinner.    anniversary dinner and then New Year's dinner.    So.    All right.    Oh, and then we want to...    Okay, so for meals...    So the first question would be anniversary dinner.    What I want to see is can we do Carol Delmar or Raiz in that order?    Yeah.    So that's my first choice.\n  01:16:56 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      This is my second choice.\n  01:16:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then other...    Otherwise, this would be, the Veraz would be third.    And then also look at those three.    Okay, so those are my most important anchors to start.    And then these are like super fancy one Michelin star restaurants, but they're so busy.\n  01:17:33 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      The only time you can get in is for lunch, not dinner.\n  01:17:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So the question there would be, and what I'm trying to figure out is basically what's availability like for, so in this case, it would be 29 or 30.\n  01:17:52 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      see here for 31.\n  01:17:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And    And okay, lunches, ideal is 12 to 1.30 window.    Dinner, ideal is 6 to 8 p.m.    window.    Okay, this is more casual.    And what I'm looking for your help on is I want to know basically my options for these nights and my options for these two.    And then based on the options, we'll then secure those reservations.    Yep.    And then, yeah, so let me just do it like this.    Okay.    Edward, top priority to assess times, and then, Edward, second priority to assess options.    Great.    Because once we have those meals figured out, then I can, why is this?    Okay.    The mezcal and mole tasting has tons of availability.    Massage, that'll have lots of availability.    Art museum can be on any day.    Teotihuacan can also be on any day, although I then am going to need to find a spot.    Special tour guide, ideal.    But that can come next.    Next.    Cool.\n  01:20:04 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Does that make sense?\n  01:20:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Yes.    Great.    Oh, and then FYI, we are staying at Sofitel Hotel.    I think it's called Reforma.    Yeah, Reforma is the district.    And then we are there from So, Sunday, the 28th.    Sunday, December 8th through.    A3, A3, A3, A3.    All right, Thursday, January 1, and we get in on the 28th, we had a super early morning, yep, all right, we get in at 1250.    January 1, 2, and then when is our departure on the 1st?    Okay, we don't leave until 6 p.m., so we could also do a lunch departure Thursday at 6 p.m.    That means night, lunch, and dinner.    Oh, and then another dinner place is going to be, so one more thing to research will be, so if you tell, Four Seasons Hotel Research.    What are the best dining options there?    Something else my wife wants.    Okay.    Edward.    Okay.    All right.    Cool.    Any questions?\n  01:23:53 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    In terms of a timeline, what's...    ...    ...    ...    What's your expectation in terms of getting back to all this?\n  01:24:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I would say sooner than later, let's definitely have it all done this week.    This is, you know, priority number one.    Let's get this, you know, let's get this figured out by like Wednesday, because I don't think that should be too difficult.    And ideally this also by Wednesday or before the end of the week, this one's a little more flexible, but it's more of, um, it's a super busy time.    Even though we're a month out, it's a super busy time of year there.    And so this is why we have to book our reservations now.\n  01:24:49 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Like these Michelin star places, they're completely.\n  01:24:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, so, but what's cool is Mexico city.    It is a lot more affordable based on the U.S.    dollar, so we can go and eat like kings, and the food's supposed to be amazing, and by American or U.S.    standards, it's a very different price equation just because of the currency conversion.\n  01:25:26 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, okay.\n  01:25:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, and by the way, just one last thing as context, this trip is our fifth year anniversary, like wedding anniversary, so that's why I'm also like, yeah, like I want to do it right, it's like if you want to eat in the fine restaurants, let's eat in fine restaurants, you know, like, yeah, we're, I want to do it right.\n  01:25:55 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Sounds good, sounds good.\n  01:25:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, cool.    All right.    Thank you, Edward.    We've covered everything.    Boom, boom, boom.    Keep me posted.    What are the most time-sensitive things?    Sort of best takeaways from our call today.\n  01:26:21 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Sending out the type form to AdventHealth, relevant partners, and Linda at WPS, scheduling, and then I think everything else, there are other priorities like boosting the job and the post, making the micro-optimizations, and then the recruitment analyst.    Sorry, the analyst recruitment.    And yeah, and then I'll get to the admin stuff.\n  01:26:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Perfect.\n  01:26:57 - Edward Njogu (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.\n  01:26:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Good admin.    admin.    admin.    Good Good    Thank you, Edward.    Great stuff.    And, um, holler if you need me.    All right.    Okay.    All right.    Talk soon.    Bye.\n",
