Use the output directly as the message body.\n\n## Transcript\n\n {{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.call_transcript }}",

Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently.

For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.

            "call_summary": "Meeting Purpose\n\nDefine a unified brand narrative to align all marketing efforts.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  - The \"Legacy Flywheel\" is the core narrative. It frames the value proposition with three interconnected pillars: Growth & Renewal (longevity), Connect & Celebrate (social), and Belong & Sustain (community).\n  - The \"Billion Dollar Slide\" is the mic-drop conclusion. It reveals the core thesis—HealthSpan is the new net worth; Longevity is the new asset class—after the audience has been guided through the concept.\n  - A \"North Star Codex\" will be created. This document will provide a single source of truth for all vendors (Seventh Art, Real Living, PR) to ensure consistent messaging and prevent brand dilution.\n  - NFT utility tokens are a future strategy (3–5 years). They can create a tradable asset class for membership and potentially streamline fractional ownership, bypassing complex real estate regulations.\n\nTopics\n\nThe Problem: Inconsistent Messaging\n\n  - Disparate marketing efforts from multiple vendors (Seventh Art, Real Living, PR) are creating brand confusion.\n  - Examples of off-brand language to be eliminated:\n      - \"Nightclub\" or \"dayclub\" → undermines the longevity focus.\n      - \"Detox/Retox\" → misaligns with the brand's ethos.\n      - \"Family resort\" → targets the wrong energy; the brand is vibrant and sophisticated.\n      - \"Luxury\" → an overused term that connotes a stuffy, traditional experience.\n\nThe Solution: A Unified Brand Narrative\n\n  - Core Thesis: HealthSpan is the new net worth; Longevity is the new asset class.\n      - This is the \"Billion Dollar Slide\" and serves as the mic-drop conclusion, not the opener, to avoid overwhelming the audience with a high-concept abstraction.\n  - The \"Legacy Flywheel\": An internal framework to guide programming and messaging.\n      - 1. Growth & Renewal: The core, focusing on personal health, biohacking, and vitality.\n      - 2. Connect & Celebrate: The social component, including curated music, arts, and culinary events.\n      - 3. Belong & Sustain: The ultimate goal, fostering community, tradition, and a multi-generational legacy.\n  - Key Messaging Concepts:\n      - Curated Access to \"What's Current and What's Next\": Positions the brand as a trendsetter providing access to relevant experiences.\n      - Ownership, Not Tourism: Emphasizes deep engagement over transactional visits.\n      - A Vehicle for a Statement: The property helps owners express their aspirational identity and values.\n\nFuture Strategy: NFT Utility Tokens\n\n  - Potential Use Cases (3–5 years):\n      - Tokenize Membership Tiers: Create a tradable asset for exclusive club access, building scarcity and value.\n      - Streamline Fractional Ownership: Potentially bypass complex real estate regulations (e.g., DRE, securities laws) by tokenizing shares of an LLC that owns a villa.\n  - Precedent: The Flyfish Club NFT restaurant raised $14M from $3,500 memberships, demonstrating the model's viability.\n  - Risk Mitigation: Implement a \"morality clause\" in the HOA to maintain community standards and control who can own a token.\n\nImmediate Action: Syndicate Deck Update\n\n  - Add a one-slide TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read) to the syndicate deck as slide two.\n  - Content: Investment thesis, IRR to date, principals' track record, and authority stack logos.\n  - Rationale: Establishes immediate institutional credibility (\"above the scroll\") before introducing the novel concept.\n\nBusiness Development Update\n\n  - Funding: Secured a $25M co-GP anchor investor and an LOI for a favorable 50% loan.\n  - Hotel Brands: Targeting luxury partners (Auberge, Rosewood, Montage) at the ALIS conference in January.\n  - Marriott Consideration: Re-evaluating Marriott's luxury portfolio (e.g., Ritz-Carlton) for a potential competitive bid, leveraging team members with senior Marriott experience.\n\nNext Steps\n\n  - Michael:\n      - Create a draft \"North Star Narrative Codex\" incorporating the new messaging framework.\n      - Export the ChatGPT persona analysis to a Google Doc for Scott's review.\n  - Scott:\n      - Review and mark up the persona analysis doc with feedback.\n      - Consult with the team on including Marriott in the hotel brand outreach.\n  - Both:\n      - Meet on Wednesday, January 7th to review the Codex draft.\n",

            "call_transcript": "  00:00:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      feels like Friday, it feels like it's already been a long week.    I think I just had, you know, everybody's just trying to tie me off for the holidays, and I've just been working for weekend, so I haven't, yeah, I've been working for like two weeks straight.    I'm battered.    I'm going to enjoy this holiday.\n  00:00:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This week's been a long, this week's been a long month.\n  00:00:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, this week's been a long month.    It's exactly how I feel.    Yeah, I do.    We just got like, I just, and like I just got off, we're we're doing this new landing page with this other, this company, and they kind of went through like a branding exercise, and I'm like, oh God, now I got a whole nother thing.    I'm like, this was like the worry, like these guys are going this direction, and these guys are going this direction, and I'm like, oh, now I got to go through this, read through all, they changed the font, they changed the text, and I'm just like, and the colors, and I'm like, my marketing director's like, what the 's going on?    So anyways, this is just small, small things.\n  00:00:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Of course.\n  00:00:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Of course, of course.\n  00:00:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, I appreciate what's that structure, structure, structure.    Well, I was about to say, it's one of the things that I love, respect, and admire so much about you.    And it's one of the things that I, you know, one of my gifts is I'm able to, I groth off people.\n  00:01:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Right.\n  00:01:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And like, so like my seven years inside meta, working with 15 different product and organizational divisions, like I downloaded like the, the mindset, the playbook of product led growth.    And when you're like solving at the billion person scale work, you know, being mastermind partners with you over the last two years.    How would I say this?    Um, I can't overstate how much influence you've had on me and me being able to really, um, strengthen structural fundamentals, which I like, like build it from the ground.    up inside the business.    And I think it's one of your superpowers.    Oh, my God.\n  00:02:05 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Some people love it.    Some people hate it.    You have to have it if you're going to have like, if you're going to repeat without like problems, right?    You've got it.    It has to be templated and structured.    know.    And every time I do it, you know, systems at scale.\n  00:02:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    at scale, right?    So I am with you.    So all right.    So I had a chance to go through everything.    I just finished running some analysis.    didn't get a chance to port it out into a Google doc.    I'll share with you the chat GPT instance.    But it reaffirmed part of where my head is at, which was great.    And so let me, I'm going to, I want to sort of show you a few different vignettes.    Okay.    And vignette number one is let's talk about the syndicate deck.    I think it's fantastic.    I have just recommendation for one slide to add.    And then we'll use that as the springboard to then go into the personas.    And I'm going to show you sort of the, like, where my head is at, which is all about how do we, like, what is the logic model kind of that we have to prioritize as decision gates?\n  00:03:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Sort of this idea of, like, what are the things that I need to believe as true in order for me to have conviction in either buying this villa or being this investor?    Yeah.    Right.\n  00:03:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And how do we reduce the complexity of that?    I just threw everything out here.\n  00:03:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That was wonderful.\n  00:03:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    It's like a larger piece.\n  00:03:41 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I know it needs to be whittled down, but.\n  00:03:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      No, no, no, no.    That's, it's the best, best way to go is to start by basically codifying your world.    And then from there, we have an, we have enough specificity and, and context detail that we can do next level inference.    Arbitrage, yeah.    Yeah, that we can really then hone in on, okay, these are the key levers.    So here's my recommendation for the syndicator deck.    And it's basically, let me put this into chat.\n  00:04:13 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Part of the reason why I sent the syndicator deck is because it lines up with one of the personas in the, like, Invest With Us.    So here's my recommendation for page two of the deck.\n  00:04:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, investment thesis in one sentence, IRR to date, track record of the principals, authority stack logos.\n  00:04:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So we have all of that in our financial deck.    Every single one of those.    have the IRR, we just did that.    We had track record with IRR and all of our partners.    And so that split up.    This was really, like, so what we have is we have, like, our core development deck.    Totally.    And then I have, like, financial deck, which is all that plus.    Plus, and then we have this, which is really what's the theory behind like how we work with syndicators.    That was it.    Completely understood.\n  00:05:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so great.    Let's port that over.\n  00:05:16 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      As I said, I think it's just an additional slide.\n  00:05:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      should be slide two.    Because think about it, for this syndicator audience, what we have to do right out of the gate is we have to basically level set.\n  00:05:31 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      This is like the hero above the scroll.    Yep.    Right?\n  00:05:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then, okay, great.    If this is my level set, investment thesis in one sentence, IIR, sort of track record of performance, then specifically the track record and pedigree of the principles and authority stack of other logos, boom.    Okay, now I want to click down.    Help me understand the making of this deal and what this is about.\n  00:05:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So that is how we do    Because we give them these in sequence.    get the first one, and then they get the financials, and we walk them through, which has all that.    We get them confident in the business, in the team, in the turns.    And then we're like, this is how we work with, this is our philosophy behind how we work with our in the process.\n  00:06:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Understood.    Understood.    I still think it belongs as a one-slide trailer at the beginning of that syndicate deck.\n  00:06:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    So all of this on one slide?    All of it on one slide.\n  00:06:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    Sure.\n  00:06:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Sure.\n  00:06:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's the TLDR that's just the like, hey, before I start taking you into this new concept and all the cool badass things that we're doing.    It's just a recap of what you already saw.\n  00:06:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.\n  00:06:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Level set.    Level set.\n  00:06:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Not product-related?    Not product-related.    You don't want to have a product-related turn as well?    Like, here's about, here's our, here's like the, here's the track record of the team, and then here's the, here's the product it returns.\n  00:06:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh, we.    When you say product-related, click down one level, what do you mean by product-related here?\n  00:07:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So they're going to be investing into a specific share class on the development of the project.    Every time they invest with us, there'll be a specific project we're probably pitching them.    But I guess it could vary.    So this is fine.    I can keep it generic to this.    That's fine.    Yeah, it's generic.\n  00:07:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's just, it's basic, like, look, here's what I want you to be able to do every, because the biggest hair on all of this is the following, on everything that you're doing, a confused buy or can't buy.    Yeah.\n  00:07:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:07:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And there's a bunch of things that you start, that you're doing with this, that's like, this is different.    This is novel.    Is this going to work out?\n  00:07:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Sure.\n  00:07:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And so what we need to, like, establish right out of the gate and keep reinforcing institutional grade.    Yeah, right.    And, and that like, and that like, you guys are like battle tested, you've got a winning formula.    Like we keep anchoring in that before we take them on this, like, imagine if, like, you know, journey into like utopia and the new like longevity revolution.\n  00:08:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I get it.    Totally get it.    No, we, we, we have just gone through that whole process with a handful of these syndicators.    And it was track record and pro forma and all that type of stuff.    I mean, we're getting two new things, which will be, which will be helpful.    I've got another investor on board right now that could be our, our, one of our anchors, 25 million as like a co-GP.    And I have, I'm getting a 50%.    I'm an LOI for a, for a very favorable 50% loan from a friendly lender.    We're doing another deal with early January.    And so that's, those are huge.    And then we're going out to market in January.    Well, if I had gone out to.    Hotel brands.    So think of like Amon's new baby brand or the one Starwood's one hotel.    Aubert's is already way, is pretty far ahead, talking to us about that.    And then a few handful of others like that as well.    All big, big brands.\n  00:09:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      They don't have the same name cachet in the US, but would you have any interest in talking with Sonny Ecos, who have built their PE-backed hypergrowth in Europe, specializing in luxury all-inclusive.    And they have a very flywheel turnkey product, and they're in major expansion mode.    Yeah, I'll talk to them.\n  00:09:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      For sure.    Sonny Ecos, this is a...    Sonny Ecos group.\n  00:09:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      They started out of Greece, and they're now also in Portugal, Spain, and Crete.\n  00:10:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, I'd definitely talk to them.    Sure.    Yeah, I mean, we're going to go one by one.    We're not going to do like a traditional RFP.    We're going to have like real high level conversations with these guys and see where that goes.    But we've already had a few conversations that people are really interested.    So we think by the end of Alice is the big hotel conference.    It's in January, end of January in LA.    Everybody will be there.    So we're going to meet with everybody.    Well, our target group.    And I think by the end of March, we'll have a brand.    I think it's that fast.    So at least like SoftCircle, Letter of Intent, ready to go, start working with us.    That is huge.\n  00:10:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Is Marriott a potential partner?    No?\n  00:10:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, it's too mass market.    Yeah.    Okay.\n  00:10:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I ask only because I know that they've become increasingly a house of brands.    Yeah.    And I did work with them years ago, and I'm still kidding.    Connected with, like, a C-suite executive over there.\n  00:11:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, we're not, we don't really have, there's no really Marriott brands that we like.    Starwood's got a few good ones, you know, obviously the rest of them.    What did we just send, who did we just send this morning?    Jay just sent me a list of them that we're talking to, and there's a few more on this list.    Hotel brands, Aubert's, Rosewood, One Star, Montage, Kersner's.    I you know that, but you know that Marriott, you know, owns the Ritz-Carlton.    And as part of, and you know that Marriott corporate basically also owns all of Starwood.\n  00:11:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So Le Meridian, W, yeah, yeah, the St.    Regis.    I mean, they are, here, let me just show you.    Like, when I say Marriott, like, this is, this is Marriott.\n  00:11:52 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, yeah.    Okay, yeah, some of those are good.    I some of them, Ritz is too fancy.    Four Seasons.    Seasons.    Four points.    No, no, no, no, no.    Luxury collection, design hotels.    I mean, I guess the luxury collection, maybe, but that's not such a, it's not really a, maybe, I mean, we've got some guys on our team and that are, I'll ask.    Okay.\n  00:12:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      No worries.    I'll ask right now.\n  00:12:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:12:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, cause the person, I think is their chief experience officer now.    Let's see.    Peggy.    I did work with her for like, like 15, 20 years ago.\n  00:12:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      She's their EVP and chief customer officer.    Oh, interesting.\n  00:12:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, and, and she used to be the global officer for customer experience, loyalty, and new ventures.\n  00:12:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, well, our, our, our director of sales was 10 years running Marriott's global, uh, vacation home sales.    Um, and that a guy I were working with was with the Marriott for 15 years.\n  00:13:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I just remembered that.\n  00:13:01 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So he was Ritz-Carlton for last eight.    Okay.\n  00:13:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, this is her here, Peggy Rowe.\n  00:13:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      What's her?\n  00:13:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      EBP and Chief Customer Officer.\n  00:13:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I'll get back to you on that.    Let me talk to got two of our guys are ex-Mariot, pretty senior guys.    So I don't know what their thoughts are.    They'll know these brands better than I do.\n  00:13:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Totally.\n  00:13:25 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      didn't come up on the initial list.    Yeah.\n  00:13:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, and look, I think that the part of this may even just be like the value of the ways in which you can create a competitive bidding process by also bringing in some of the big dogs.\n  00:13:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, I get it.    We're trying, we had this discussion, we're trying not to run like a traditional RFP because some of these sexier brands, they don't    don't want to think that they're second fiddle.    They want to know that we like you, we came to you, so, like, we're a little bit nervous about going too broad in the beginning.    Understood.    Because, like, they might be like, well, , you're shopping around at 10 people?    Like, I'm not going to participate in that.\n  00:14:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    That's what we're worried about.\n  00:14:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So we're going to be a little bit more targeted this first round and try and curate our targets.    And if we fail, then we'll go to round two.\n  00:14:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Yeah.    But I appreciate it.\n  00:14:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Absolutely.\n  00:14:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    So, all right.    So we're going to get that one slide.    Now let's go over to this.    All right.    What I started to build out.    And so, by the way, I'll have this all outputted for you that basically takes each buyer persona.\n  00:14:59 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      own.    No, let me see if I can make this bigger for you.    Oh, that's great.\n  00:15:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Is this in your story?\n  00:15:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, yeah, StoryTTP.    Cool.    Yep.\n  00:15:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Here, I'll share with you the instance.    love your templatizer.    Thank you.    love language.\n  00:15:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n  00:15:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right, let me stop sharing screen here for a second, put it into chat.    Okay, so you have direct access to the instance, but then if we generate more through it, just know, like, so for instance, you could start generating questions in there as well.    Like, you can keep working in this instance that I just gave you.    And, but know that whatever else you generate, I won't see it unless you reshare a shared link with me.\n  00:15:45 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Interesting.    How do I share a shared link with you?\n  00:15:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let me show you how to do that.    Okay, so let's go back to.\n  00:15:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, my God, that's so cool.    Boy, they're picking up the game a little bit.    So up top here, top right corner.\n  00:16:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So you go up here to share button.    See it right here?\n  00:16:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And then, yeah, it takes a moment to generate.\n  00:16:09 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Occasionally it fails.    And then you go copy link and you share the copy link.    Just know the following, just as an FYI, if you post one of these instances on X, LinkedIn, or Reddit, that entire instance becomes indexed by the internet.\n  00:16:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    I won't be pressing that.    Right.\n  00:16:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      No, I know.    But exactly.    I'm just educating you just as an awareness.    Okay.    But otherwise, yeah.    So anyway, so all right.    So what it did was it took the buyer personas.    And for each persona, I also had it force rank the value propositions.\n  00:16:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And then break down for each value prop.\n  00:16:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is the value.    actually delivers core motivational driver, primary.    Very perceptual challenge and what we must, what must be proven to unlock conviction.    Okay.    So it sort of like builds out all these kinds of like inferences.\n  00:17:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Love this.    Love this.\n  00:17:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:17:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    So we have this for each of the personas and then similarly on the investor side.    Oh, love it.    This is so simple.    Love it.    Okay.\n  00:17:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Because what we have to do now is we need to force function down what you built as the like, okay, here's the 13 page brief.    And we've got to force function it down to something that can drive decision-making, right?    No, it's perfect.    Yeah.    Right.    You did exactly what we needed to.    So, and then furthermore, so then I have this.    Okay.    And then I was like, okay, good.    But I know that we need to, okay.    So then I then focused on a mess, a prioritized messaging hierarchy.    All right.    Which I thought was really interesting.    So take for Villa buyers and member owners.    Level one category frame.    I Yung Yung    What game are we playing?    One, COVA is not a second home.    It's a performance and connection platform disguised as real estate.    Why this must come first.    Buyers must reframe comparison away from houses, resorts, and destinations immediately.    Message two, this is a place you actually use weekly, not a place you justify annually.    Kills buyer remorse and novelty decay.    Fear early.    Three, design for progression, not escape.    Signals long-term value and seriousness.    Okay.    Now, again, these are directional, right?    We're going to play with these and adjust them.    But you kind of get a sense of the decision gates and how we need to take people through a series of decision gates.    Value stack.    Why is this better than alternatives?    A living ecosystem for health, performance, and connection.    This is an upgrade to my life, not a luxury indulgence.    Programmed experiences that compound over time.    I will not outgrow this.    Facilities and operators built for daily use.    This is credible, not performative.    Social gravity that makes hosting effortless.    This improves my relationships.    Proof and de-risking, why this actually will work.    Named operators, advisors, and partners, like wellness theater skepticism we're addressing, clear day-in-the-life use cases, right?    We're addressing abstraction and imagination gaps, visible programming calendar, fierce staleness.    You get the idea here.    Now let's get to the capital side.    Because I think, by the way, I think we have to lead with the investor side first, and then we go to the villas.    Because even your villa buyers are investors first.\n  00:19:40 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So, you know, I don't know about that.    Here's what I would say.    I think that there will be for sure.    We were just having this discussion.    The guys on the team are like, you know what?    A lot of these guys, some of these folks have so much money that it's really about buying into.    Do something unique that resonates with them.    They'll eventually have their financial people, accountants, whatever, dig into the details.    Like a lot of times they just go in there and be like, I want the two bedroom and then they'll give it to someone else to negotiate, right?\n  00:20:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I totally understand.    And I agree that basically put it to you this way.    What you're selling is for what money can't buy.    Yeah, that's right.\n  00:20:25 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's right.\n  00:20:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right, that is, and I want you to write that down because that is actually the North Star in the sense of basically, you know, this is what we're talking about around like longevity and that like health, like health span, health span is the new, is the new wealth and asset class.\n  00:20:43 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And if you have, right.\n  00:20:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So know that we're selling into that yet, because we're selling something that's still unproven, it's a big high concept.    But I still think that, and look, you can have a.    Slide one, that's like, you know, some aspirational abstract, you know, we've got like our longevity, you know, like luxury, real estate, blah, blah, blah.    Great.    But slide two, we hit them with something that has that financial, like value prop that sets again this cognitive floor.    Because what we're then doing is we're passing the decision gate, where they're like, oh, okay, great.    Like this, this belongs in my world, because nobody wants to invest in a loser.    Nobody wants to invest in a money losing proposition.    So we just need to like, it's almost like we just need to like, say it to get it out of the way.\n  00:21:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?    And then we can then take them on the ride in the journey of like, and look, you're buying something that no other, very few of your other investments can provide this level of multi-stack value, including all the things money can't buy.    Yep.\n  00:22:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, so that's where, so it's like, look, if we look at the capital deck, what investors must believe first.    Lifestyle real estate fails when it relies on novelty and hope, right?    Demand durability now comes from usage, not aspiration.    Cova monetizes behavior, not tourism.    Reframes revenue stability.    Business model.    Villa sales supported by an amenity-driven demand engine.    STR premium driven by access, not location alone.\n  00:22:36 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:22:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What does that mean, access?\n  00:22:41 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Pricing power explained.    that, yeah, is that, is that access, like, is that related to the scarcity of the product in the market, or?    That's a good question.\n  00:22:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Let's, let's ask it to clarify its inference.    By the way, what does STR stand for here?\n  00:22:57 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Short-term rental.    Thank you.\n  00:23:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Got it.    Because it's membership-driven.    Right.\n  00:23:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    So that there's- Access to scarce experiences.\n  00:23:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh-huh.\n  00:23:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Manity access.    Okay.    Got it.    Supplies gated by design.    unique experience.\n  00:23:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Short-term rental.\n  00:23:48 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      They can't find anywhere else.    Yeah.    Okay.    Got it.\n  00:23:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is really interesting.    I'm glad we- and Let's    I'm glad we clicked down on this one.    The.    Okay, so then back to.\n  00:24:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There really are no other resorts that have all of this out in the desert right now, because they're all they're all a lot of them are built for real residential communities, not for the purpose of entertainment or wellness or anything related.    Like they were not activity focused, they have one activity and that tends to be they have a clubhouse golf.\n  00:24:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.    Yeah, golf and spa.\n  00:24:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And they're and they're growing some of these things are renovating or upgrading, but it's not part of their DNA.    It's like we got a really nice spa.    We got a great hot and cold plunge.    They have those things, but it's not really.    Yeah, it's not phenomenal.    Yeah.\n  00:24:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um.    Yeah.    Something that's coming to mind here is something of how do we communicate the new luxury lifestyle or like longevity?    How about longevity is the new luxury?    That's actually interesting.    Longevity is the new luxury.\n  00:25:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      How do we think about it in that sense?    guess that's, I mean, I think that's, it's the new, it's like longevity is the new amenity, right?    It is the new luxury.\n  00:25:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It is the new.    Well, here's what is captured in that statement of longevity is the new luxury.    What we're basically saying is, look, like, this is the new category of luxury home or luxury vacation home.\n  00:25:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Right.\n  00:25:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then what we're also alluding to, see, when we say longevity is the new luxury.    Like longevity is the new asset class.    Longevity, health span is the like, you know, that's the ultimate expression of your net worth.\n  00:26:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Well, how do I, you know, one thing I liked about, I agree with that, but one thing I liked about what you said last time, which I thought was interesting, and I've been mulling about this, was the idea of this like dynamic destinations, right?\n  00:26:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:26:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Longevity is one part of it, but there's also the sports, which I think could be, you know, like the activity, the communal, and maybe even eventually the music and the entertainment, like having all of those separate paths.    I was a little bit worried in the beginning where it was like, well, what's the overarching story?    Because you don't want to be like jack of all trades, but they're, they're, they do, they're, they're symbiotic, right?    And how they, how they flow and work together.    So I, I, one, one area that I'm, I'm more aware of now after our last conversation is do we want to completely drive?    Our whole value prop through longevity?    Or is it through this sort of dynamic, like the dynamism of having these, this interest, these, these different pathways?    It still is kind of similar, right?    It's social and it's wellness.    And then it's, there's this, there's this really interesting, if we can get this music off the ground, I mean, that'll be game changing for the product.\n  00:27:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The, the thing there would be, it's, I still, so I still, I still, the place that you have conviction, the thing that has durability for you is longevity.\n  00:27:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's longevity.    So, own longevity.\n  00:27:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I think that cultural experiences and social experiences.    It's simply a plank as part of longevity.    Yeah.\n  00:28:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      belonging.\n  00:28:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      agree with that.    Another way to talk about this is like celebrate, right?    Yeah.    Like, you know, and like celebrate, celebrate life.    Like celebrate, you know, the- I like that.    Yeah.    Yeah, I like that.    And it's the, you know, oh, back to way, here's another key word.    It's also around, so the social component, the cultural components are around vitality.\n  00:28:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, I like that.    That's better than energy.    I like that.    That's a good word.    I like the celebration component to it.    That feels right.\n  00:28:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    It's like celebrate the good life.    Like, you know, like experience vitality.    And part of vitality is about being inspired.    And part of vitality is about, you know, dynamic, you know, dynamic destination.    And dynamic experiences.    You know, vitality is about always be learning and growing.\n  00:29:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Vitality is about being plugged in to what's new and what's current.    Oh, these are great, Michael.    Yeah, you're right.    This is great.    I like this.    That's great.    And here's what I love about the vitality piece is that it serves as the balancing force.\n  00:29:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like it's the balancing pillar or plank to in any couple or any family, you're going to have your like longevity nerd or the one that's like, oh, yeah, I want to get into all this stuff.    And then you're going to have the other partner that's going to be like, yeah, that's not really my thing.    And then it's like, oh, it's kind of like, you know, going on the cruise and it's like, oh, don't worry, there's something for everyone.    And that's where you have the vitality like portfolio, like the vitality programming that speaks.    To especially those who may be a little less inspired or motivated by all the longevity stuff.\n  00:30:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Well, that's the dynamic experience, right?    Right.    Yeah.    Options in there for them.    Like, of the, here's the classic stereotypes, okay?\n  00:30:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I'm going to overgeneralize here.    An alpha male overachiever who's obsessed about longevity in their own health, and they're tracking all their stats, and they want to do all the longevity.    And then their wife, that is a social butterfly maven, right?    Who just loves to network and connect and experience great experiences.\n  00:30:41 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Right?    Bread and butter.\n  00:30:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Peanut butter and jelly.    Yeah.\n  00:30:46 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  00:30:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Longevity and vitality.\n  00:30:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's just the energy, quite as well.    Yeah.    And that's the energy, the social dynamics, the community.    energy.    Thank you.    Right.    Yeah.    Yeah.    So one is a little bit more in like, in like internal and one is a little bit more external in a sense.    Yes.\n  00:31:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:31:12 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I can, I can very much get behind that too.\n  00:31:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    so by the way, so this is a really interesting set of contrast frames.    Lifestyle real estate.    Okay.    What did I say before in the session?\n  00:31:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's like me, us.    then, um, yeah.    Okay.    Anyways.    Right.    Sorry.    Oh, no.\n  00:31:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All good.    Sorry.    You want to, you, uh, you want to close that loop you're saying about me, us.\n  00:31:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, I just thinking like we were doing the different personas.    Like the first one I was thinking was like, it was like, what's in it for me.\n  00:31:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And next one is like, what's in it for us.\n  00:31:46 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    And that us is a little bit more like that, that vitality.    Right.    Where the me is more of like the, the social, the guys, like, how am I going to improve my my life?    Right.    Yes.\n  00:31:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:31:59 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.\n  00:32:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And the, well, and I think to your point, the, the, so almost think about it this way.    You could, you can also think about it as these like concentric circles.\n  00:32:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.\n  00:32:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So for instance, the inner circle could be in a way, learn and grow.\n  00:32:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.\n  00:32:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The next concentric circle is connect and celebrate.    I like to celebrate and connect.\n  00:32:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like it a lot.\n  00:32:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And then, and then the third, the third concentric circle could be something like, these aren't the right words, but it's basically like belong and sustain.\n  00:32:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    Yeah, I get.    Yeah, right.    Because remember, people, it's kind of like online learning, people come for the product, people, people come for the product, they stay for the community.    The connect and celebrate works really well together, too, because it doesn't sound like my biggest concern about like, you do want to have people are going to want to celebrate, but you don't want to go, you don't want to use the word party, right?    It's just, it's chalk and cheese with, you know, with longevity, but celebration, this is what it is, is right in line with that.\n  00:33:30 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, and you know what I would put actually in the center as opposed to learn and grow?    How about, how about grow and renew?    Growth and renewal.    Growth and renewal.    Because that's better than transform, right?\n  00:33:45 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yes, with so much more, right?    Right.\n  00:33:47 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because growth and renewal, basically, again, remember, we're selling longevity.    So longevity, this is, is span.    So you want to grow, grow muscle tissue, grow, you know, grow.    Feeling stronger, mental vitality, you name it.    So grow.    And then the renewal part is like empty out, let go, revitalize, refresh.    So growth and renewal, and then connect and celebrate.    And then like belong and sustain.    And I think part of the power of belong and sustain, what I would anchor that to is that there is, that goes back to the dynamic destination.    You'll never be bored, because there's always going to be like new experiences, new adventures.    We become the place where your family learns and grows and comes back again and again.    There's that piece of like, it's like the ritual of, it's the tradition.\n  00:35:01 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      The belong and sustain part?    Uh-huh.\n  00:35:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah.\n  00:35:04 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So sustain in terms of just coming back and growing with it.    So, I mean, these are all kind of interconnected, right?    So they don't, they can stand on their own, but they're also, they also overlap a little bit.\n  00:35:14 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Well, and what I'm suggesting though, because you talked about this inner versus outer.\n  00:35:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    So this is why I would think about it like this.    Oh, I got it.    I got it.    Right?    I got it.\n  00:35:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?\n  00:35:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So like, yeah.\n  00:35:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I was thinking like, So like the inner circle is growth and renewal.    The next circle is, you know, connect and celebrate.    And then belong and sustain.\n  00:35:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      But the core is growth and renewal.    Yep.\n  00:35:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.\n  00:35:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Connect and celebrate that is really.    Really, the social component, and then all of the fun activities.    Exactly.\n  00:36:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?\n  00:36:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Exactly.\n  00:36:06 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Celebrating life.\n  00:36:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It could be sports.    It could be dinners.    It could be music.    And then the long and sustained, that's like the overarching, it's kind of what you're left with, right?\n  00:36:16 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, as well as like tradition, community, like basically it's community.    It's a, you know, a tradition, like a family tradition.    And, and I would also, I would also actually play with the word continuity.    Like, the continuity piece, like continuity comes from repetition.    Continuity comes from tradition and also continuity comes from legacy.    So this is how you turn this into both a finance, a financial asset.    As well as a behavioral asset, right?    Becomes a behavioral asset of like you're imprinting these values into multi-generational, you know, legacy.\n  00:37:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's also the concept of the habit forming, right?\n  00:37:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      For the individual and the family.    Yeah, got it.\n  00:37:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    And sustained can also be financial sustained.    So that works for all three of the archetypes.\n  00:37:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You got it.\n  00:37:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      How do you lay this out, though, in a framework that's like, what do we do with this?\n  00:37:36 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right now, I would turn this into an internal framework that's really basically the, I would call this the like the internal, like, it's basically like the programming value stack.    Like, um...    Um...    um...    uh, review It's Like, uh, would the창is, know, uh, So Thank    Now, actually, you know what?    Here's another way we could do this.    Instead of actually the concentric circles, we could actually simply turn this.    I know you have a longevity stack, but what we could also turn this into is actually a flywheel.\n  00:38:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    Okay.    So it just continues to go to the figure eight, really.\n  00:38:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      just kind of continues to...    Well, I wouldn't do it a figure eight.    would just make it a circle, right?    So all of this inner growth and renewal, connect and celebrate, belong and sustain.    And it's just a circle that basically, these are like the three components that feed each other as a flywheel.\n  00:38:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    Right.\n  00:38:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And actually, what I would call this then is the...    I mean, here's part of the...    Um...    Interesting.    You know what I might call this?\n  00:39:05 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I might call this the legacy flywheel.\n  00:39:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because you're asking people to make an investment.    And we then can basically show them how this investment compounds, not just financially.    And within this flywheel are the different entry points for the different family members.    Maybe your husband and your kids aren't into this longevity thing and doing the biohacking, but you'll get them on Connect and Celebrate, right?    So it sort of is like there's something for everyone here.\n  00:39:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.    This is sort of kind of leads into that.    But part of this is complimentary, right?    It's really kind of leading the circle when you're doing this.\n  00:39:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:40:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I think everybody would, the idea is they would touch part of it.    I mean, the ultimate is to really get into that belonging and sustaining, right?\n  00:40:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.\n  00:40:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I mean, the experience of like the growth and renewal and the connect and celebrate is kind of more of the active elements where the belonging and sustaining is sort of ultimate goal, right?\n  00:40:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Because remember what you're ultimately selling here, we are selling an aspirational lifestyle identity.\n  00:40:31 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    That's what you're building here.\n  00:40:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      This is a lifestyle brand and we're selling an aspirational identity.    And what we're actually selling to the single or couple decision maker is how they can embed this aspirational identity.    Entire family units into a multi-generational flywheel.\n  00:41:19 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.\n  00:41:21 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then it's like, you know, now you're selling me on, I am, I'm literally installing an ETH.    Like, here's another way to think about this.    Yeah, I'm installing an ETHOS and set of values, as well as the gathering place for my family.\n  00:41:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And friends, right?    Yes, exactly.    So the values, it's also, the values also for, shouldn't, it shouldn't go back to then, it's a gathering place for me.    And for us, right?    Because it's also, they may not be coming, they could be coming solo, they could be coming with their partner, right?\n  00:42:08 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Yep.    And what we're selling to people, though, is actual ownership of your aspirational identity and lifestyle.\n  00:42:23 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Say again?    Right.\n  00:42:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You're selling owner, like what you're offering people is ownership into their aspirational identity and lifestyle.\n  00:42:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  00:42:43 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You're not transacting here just as a tourist.    You're not just transacting here as a guest.    You're not transacting You're not transacting here.\n  00:42:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You're not transacting here.    You're transacting here.    You're You're\n  00:43:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So you're, you're, you're offering, we're inviting people, we're, yeah, we're inviting people into ownership of aspirational identity and lifestyle.\n  00:43:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Into aspirational, aspirational what?    Identities and lifestyle.    Yes.\n  00:43:24 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Aspirational identity and lifestyle.    Yeah.    Yeah.    Well, and basically what I would say, like, we're, inviting people to have ownership into longevity as an aspirational identity and lifestyle.\n  00:43:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, that I, that I understand.    Yeah.\n  00:43:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.\n  00:43:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That goes back to, uh, Yeah.    Bye.    It goes back to that concept, what money can't buy, right?\n  00:44:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.    But it can't.\n  00:44:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Technically, it kind of can.    I mean, in some sense, right?\n  00:44:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, how about the following?    It's, what we're saying to people is that there are choices that you can make that will bring you closer to that which money can't buy.    Say that again?\n  00:44:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There are choices you can make.\n  00:44:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      There are choices that you can make that bring you closer to that which money can't buy.    Because, Scott, at the end of the day, nobody gets out alive.\n  00:45:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    We're all going to die.\n  00:45:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But there are choices that you can make that will bring you closer to that which money can't buy, which then goes back to HealthSpan as the new net worth.\n  00:45:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And again, part of that is that social element, the belonging.\n  00:45:23 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, exactly.    Right.    But by the way, HealthSpan as the new net worth really is the.\n  00:45:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's that's that's that's it, though.    It is HealthSpan.\n  00:45:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's that's what it is.    OK, well, and so I just want you to know your core thesis is HealthSpan as the new net worth.    And then we have built a vehicle where longevity is a new asset class.    That's your two that's your twofold plank.\n  00:45:57 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We have built a vehicle or longevity.\n  00:46:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    It's the new asset class.\n  00:46:02 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.\n  00:46:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So we've built a financial instrument for you to participate in and unlocking HealthSpan as the new net worth.\n  00:46:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like it.    HealthSpan is the new net worth.    We have built a vehicle where longevity is the new asset class.    And then you just tweak that a little bit?\n  00:46:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    I mean, that's it directionally, right?\n  00:46:31 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So HealthSpan is the new net worth.\n  00:46:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Longevity is the new asset class.    That's how I would just basically explain it.    And it's almost like you could even put both of them on one slide with a diagonal slash across the slide.    And basically what we're saying, because what we're basically saying is, look, HealthSpan is the new net worth.    This is what everybody wants.    wants.    And then...    Longevity is the new asset class.    This is the vehicle that we've built.\n  00:47:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Got it.    It's cool.    that right there is your billion dollar slide.\n  00:47:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  00:47:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like that.    I like that.\n  00:47:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      But I think it tailors really well.\n  00:47:25 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I think what we've worked out here, which is kind of starting to click for me, is that we can frame it like this.    And then I think we have to go into defining this sort of legacy flywheel, sort of what you're going to get, a value flywheel, right?    And then show them that there's something for everybody.    Because that's what, like, we're going from this, like, and health span component.    But what people, we don't want them to misinterpret that there's an element of social, there's an element of celebration, right?    These are all beneficial to your health.    Well, it's not just the biohacking, it's this.    And let me be clear, that slide that I just shared, that's your money slide that comes at the end, not at the beginning.    Oh, interesting.    Okay.    Really interesting.\n  00:48:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes, because it's basically, it's the great reveal at the end, right?    Because if we lead with that abstraction up front, people will be like, wait, where are we?    What the hell are you talking about?    And then we're playing, we're basically playing defense of like, oh, wait, hold on, let me explain this to you.    Here's what I mean.    Here's what, no, no, no.    It's a conclusion slide that's like mic drop at the end.    Yeah.\n  00:48:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  00:48:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Where then they go, oh, , that just makes so much, the journey that you've just taken me on, like, it's the punchline.    Because we don't want to overwhelm them with too high of a concept up front, right?    If it's too high concept, if it's too unfamiliar, people will be like, oh.    Cool, but this sounds a little out there.    All right, we're just revealing to them in the end.    And same thing, by the way, that I would say around this legacy flywheel.    This is one of the concluding slides.\n  00:49:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I feel like I need a really simple slide as well.    Like, just kind of, I don't know if you can see that, but...    Pull it further back.\n  00:49:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, know what?    Yeah, cover your face.    There you go.    Okay, great.    Now, bring it closer in.    Closer in.    A little bit higher.    A little bit further back.\n  00:49:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's actually just like a circle in the middle with spokes, with like spirit, sports, clinic, community, sustainability, movement, sleep.    Like, just all the, like the kind of hub and stock model, all the different modalities.    they kind of go, oh, I get it.    That's all health span, right?    That's all longevity.    Okay.    And you know what?    I might...\n  00:50:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So what I might sort of title that slide for now, I might title it something for everyone.\n  00:50:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.\n  00:50:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then you can have a subhead later on that slide that basically says the like, oh, here's our full comprehensive, you know, like longevity formula, blah, blah, blah.    But the point of this is, we've got, you know, something for everyone.    And it's basically the point is, look, your family member can plug in anywhere they want across these 10 or 12, you know, quadrants or, you know, 12 points.\n  00:50:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      it still has that core nexus, which is longevity, wellness, which people may not even understand that some of these modalities are related, but at least it ties it all together, right?\n  00:50:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    So even the kiddos going out and playing, you know, putting down the cell phones, right?    Yes.    So let's, let's talk about.    How to action all this stuff.    And you got a lot of moving pieces here.    Stuff's moving fast.    Where, what is the, so remind me again.    So the first deck that we're solving for is investor deck.    And is it furthermore the syndicate one?    Because that's, that's got the kind of the kind of widest audience.    Like basically, the syndicate, hold on, let let me finish my question.    Is this, is it the syndicate deck?    Because that's the place where the story has to speak for its elf.    Because you're going to have surrogates who have to carry, carry the torch.\n  00:51:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So the biggest issue that we're having right now is that we have lots of different third party marketing going on right now.    And we don't have an overarching message.    I've got this company called Seventh Art, which is doing our decks.    I've got a company called Real Living, which is doing our landing page.    they just kind of went through a branding phase.    I've got our PR company over here, and I'm our internal.    And so if we don't start to really come up with a clear language on, like, here's what we are, here's what we stand for, here's how we're communicating our value proposition, we can then get nuanced in whether or not we're targeting.\n  00:52:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So we need a North Star Codex.    That's the most important.\n  00:52:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And everything else will flow through that.    And if that's set, we can do everything else and just improve on it over time.    If not, we're going to be retrenching all of these concepts and then redoing.\n  00:52:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, got it.    So what I need to do then is I will take, because here's the ingredients.    The ingredients then are...    So these personas and the inference that I've kind of narrowed down on, these overarching mental models that you and I have just discussed, and then the two decks that you shared with me in our last session, that kind of have a bunch of click down, like details and specificity, you know, of really, really looking at this both as the, in essence, the Villa product, and the, and then also like the investor product.    And then, let me see what other key ingredients go into this that you've shared.    I think that's it.    And it just needs, we just need to, we just need to package this up into.    Just give it, give it some structured thinking so that no matter who your partner is, like whatever vendor, whatever partner, wherever someone is in this end-to-end value chain, we actually have a single, we have a single source of truth that starts to, that everyone's singing from the same song sheet.\n  00:54:20 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's it.    And then, you know, that way the variance that we're going to see is going to be five or 10% and not 75%.    And we can pull them back here and be like, guys, don't know if that quite, that's my line.    I think that that's, that would be amazing because that, that would then at least keep those folks in line.    I can get buy-in from my partner and our team and then everybody can do what they do.    And then we can continue to fine tune and craft and grow, but at least they were like, okay, the foundation is solid.    And that's always that umbrella story is what we've been missing.\n  00:54:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Got it.    All right.    you next time.    As I go solve for that, what are, give me three to five examples of where the tail's wagging the dog, we're, like, basically tell me what you're not.    What are you seeing in some of these downstream, like this rebranding thing?    Tell me the  that your pet peeves.\n  00:55:21 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It was like, we're , you know, like, I don't drink  Merlot.    Give me those super passionate steaks in the ground.\n  00:55:27 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We're not this, we're not that.\n  00:55:29 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      The big thing is that, that really pissed me off, and I lost it a few times, where, like, you have this music venue next door, they keep calling it a  nightclub.    And I'm like,  rip that word out of your lexicon, or it's the dayclub.    And I'm like, guys, we can have that element to it.    You can't call it a dayclub and have a longevity center next door.    Or, like, my business partner sometimes, he's wonderful.    He'll call it, he, like, it's the yin and the yang, right?    Right?    No, no, sorry.    That's okay.    He's like, it's the detox retox.\n  00:56:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And I'm like, no, no, no freaking detox retox, right?\n  00:56:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Celebration is great.    You know, the live music venue where you're on a journey and an experience and emotional transformation, that's amazing.    Can they have 10 margaritas?    Sure.    But it's not about the booze.    It's about the experience, right?    And so those are kind of the elements that drive me bonkers.\n  00:56:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Great.    Give me, give me, these are perfect examples.    Give me a few more.    I love this level of message discipline.\n  00:56:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      What are you not?    We are not, we're not a family.    So we're selling to families, but we're not communicating ourselves as like the family resort.    We just can't.\n  00:56:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And tell me more about that.    Why?    So because everybody throws these pictures of the families and everybody's going to have that.\n  00:56:55 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      All the, all resorts are like that.    Like this is not a, it's not an adult only place.    But the fact that we have three or four bedroom places, it's naturally going to be built for that.    But I think we really want to market this as sort of that younger, like the vitality, right?    And not market it to that, like, you know, people are like, oh, our buyers are going be older.    I'm like, yeah, but they want to hang out with the cool kids, the young kids, right?    They want to be a part of that.    And that's what we're selling.    We're kind of selling that more youthful energy, vitality.    So that's sort of an area that I always want to put guardrails on.    Well, let ask you this.\n  00:57:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Does that also maybe suggest, though, here's what I hear in this.    And maybe this makes sense from a demographic, psychographic perspective.    I think you'll probably have a lot more success going after families where you've got tweens and teens.    They're at a certain age.    They're age.    Right?    Where it's like, hey, I need to keep, you know, I've got, I've got, you know, I've got picky, like, you know, I've got, I've got kind of my bratty, you know, sort of, kind of my disaffected tweens and teens, I need to have something to keep them engaged and sustained.    And if I have a kid that's at the age of tween or teen, I'm probably demographically now in my 50s, plus, we're now also I'm caring a lot more about longevity, right?    Like, it might be just an intro, as opposed to like, hey, we're for the 30, 40 year old, you know, entrepreneur with, you know, the two year old and five year old kids.    And it's not that you can't be for them.    But I think you're probably going to attract more of that sort of different generational phase, right?    that's right.\n  00:58:48 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And I think it's almost, it's also like one of these things, too, where you have like, my kids are like, oh, God, Dad, you have something in Coachella?    You're how close to the music festival?    That is so cool.    And so there's that element of like, promote.    Being cool to the younger kids and the parents are stoked.    The parents have what they need, right?    And the kids are excited.    So it's like, and so anything but stuffy, anything but, we're not traditional.    We're not quiet.    We just had a slow conversation.    Like you go to all these other golf club communities out there, they're dead.    There's no one in there.    They're also, those are all the isolating.    We're not.    We're like the opposite.    We've kind of pushed our houses together on purpose, allowing people to see each other a little bit more.\n  00:59:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So not, not traditional, not stuffy, not dead.    It's, it's dynamic destination.    It's vibrant.    Very vibrant.\n  00:59:42 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It's longevity and vitality.    Yeah.    And we were also thinking too, it's, it's got like, it's sophisticated.    Like if you look at all these resorts, they market themselves exactly the same.    It's this premier luxury white glove service in the Maldives were amazing.    We want to be a little bit more tongue-in-cheek.    A little bit more sophisticated and sassy.    A little bit more of an Fathom.    Like, we're confident, right?    These are confident, sophisticated urban dwellers.\n  01:00:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So here's what I hear about this, then.    With a, for lack of a better word, with a pop culture sensibility.    Yeah, sure.    Again, with cultural relevance.\n  01:00:22 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, yeah.    But it is kind of pop culture relevance, right?    It's not like, you know, it's not like...    What's the...    Martha's Vineyard, right?    That's right.\n  01:00:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I mean, we're selling to a market.\n  01:00:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      This is the LA.    We're selling to the LA community, LA-San Diego, right?    Where Hollywood has a little bit of an influence in that sense.    So there's going to be more of like your Venice Beach, you know, boho, but higher end.    Yes.\n  01:00:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, and so...    So here's another key phrase.    This is you'll perpetually be selling, delivering, and providing.    It's exciting.    Ah, you'll like this.    What's current and what's next?    Yeah, that's great.    Okay, what's current and what's next?\n  01:01:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I love that.\n  01:01:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I love that.\n  01:01:14 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Michael, that's great.    I love that.\n  01:01:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We're constantly plugging into, we're plugging people into what's current and what's next.    Because guess what, Scott, this is how you maintain relevance as a human being.\n  01:01:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I keep on saying we're the cool kids, right?    And I didn't mean cool kids in the sense that we're like, I just meant in the sense that we know what's now.    Like, we're the trendsetters.    That's right.\n  01:01:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    See, that's what maintains relevance, is being connected to what's current and what's next.    And by the way, that's what music festivals do a great job of.\n  01:01:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So that's why we're relevant.    I know you like relevance, but yes.    Mm-hmm.\n  01:01:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    Yes.    Well, the...    But by the way, that whole piece of what's current and what's next, absolutely, let's graph that into the nut graph summary of relevant partners or maybe someday relevance.    But that whole piece, that's what you sell, what's current and what's next.\n  01:02:24 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Brilliant.    I mean, we could even be really tongue-in-cheek on our website and be like, we are relevant.    Is that too cheesy?    No?    Too much?\n  01:02:33 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It becomes too much of a dad.    You're embarrassing me now.\n  01:02:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Okay.    No.    So we have to signal.\n  01:02:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We can't say it outright.    Instead, you signal it.    The way you signal it is we plug you into what's, you know, we basically like you get access.    Like we're plugging you into what's current and what's next.    All right.    Curated access.    Yes.\n  01:02:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like that is...    Yeah.    That is, now we're talking the sophistication that I'm looking for.    This is great.    Curated access.    mean, that could be the health and wellness.    It could be the music.    It could be the Coachella.    could be these events.    That is great.\n  01:03:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And by the way, here's the other modifier that I would throw in to help anchor and balance the Coachella piece so that it doesn't just become like,  yeah, rock and roll, hedonism.    Music and arts.\n  01:03:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, we've talked about that, like culture.\n  01:03:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Yeah, music and arts, right?    So that also allows you to expand programming and things that also just come into like creative expression.\n  01:03:48 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You know, that's interesting.    There's all this, like the desert actually has a lot of art.    Yeah, there is.    It's one of the biggest art colonies of Southern California is all those artists out in the desert.\n  01:04:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      those in, sure.\n  01:04:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I was also thinking on the culinary side too, we could go out to all the chefs in the area and do like celebrity chef weekends.    And there's an element of like, you talk about community, but there's also an element of like neighborhood community that we're trying to pull in.    Yeah.\n  01:04:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I do like that.\n  01:04:23 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      What's current, what's next, plugging people in, you know, that's like an early stage.    I think, cause that kind of sets the, that sets the tone of like, what is it?    I, what, where I get stuck, I think sometimes, and what I don't like, we don't like the word luxury.\n  01:04:39 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.\n  01:04:40 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Cause it's, it has that connotation of white glove, traditional lifestyle I think is overused.    So we need to have a lexicon that communicates that.    think what is current, what is next, plugging you in or plugging get people in.    And I also liked the idea of when he said, we're not guests, we're not guests or.    we're we're guests, guests, guests, we're we're guests,    Uh, we're not guests or customers.\n  01:05:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Or you're not guests or clients.\n  01:05:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Like we're part of the community or we're like, well, you're owner, like you're an owner, right?\n  01:05:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like you're, um, I'm sorry.    The word is ownership.\n  01:05:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yes.    That's better.    If there's ownership.    Yeah.    Ownership.\n  01:05:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    Um, like you're not, you're not a guest.    You're not a customer.    This is ownership.    And that's the same thing.\n  01:05:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      think also with the people that are coming there for the weekends, right?    The idea is they're, they want them to have ownership in their experience.    Yes.\n  01:05:38 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And, and of the, and feel like they belong.\n  01:05:40 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.\n  01:05:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Yeah.\n  01:05:43 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's okay.    If they're tried.\n  01:05:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Okay, cool.\n  01:05:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Awesome.    So, so the next step, what do we do?    We take this, I play around with that, uh, story.    So a couple of things.\n  01:05:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So here's what I'm going to do.    I'm going to have, I'll have Edward export that instance, put it into a Google Doc, because what I want you to do is mark it up with plus ones and deltas.    Where do we need to tighten the bolts on some of its stack ranking and sort of the causality sequences it's laid out?\n  01:06:18 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Meanwhile, I'm going to take what we have here as good enough to run a cycle to build the North Star narrative codex.    Ah, sweet.    Okay, that, you know, and the goal here is minimum viable to get a working draft.    I agree.    I think that's best.\n  01:06:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We just want to scaffold it with some of these core concepts, right?    Including we'll tackle the, this is what we are, this is what we're not.\n  01:06:46 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.\n  01:06:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      These are some of the things that we're reframing, old story, new story.\n  01:06:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.    Right.\n  01:06:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And, and then, and really anchor on.    On this longevity is the new asset class and healthspan is the new net worth.\n  01:07:08 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That was neat.    And then we put, you know, like, exactly.\n  01:07:13 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then there's something for everyone that becomes the like, you know, 12 different spokes of programming.    And then also this message around curated access to both what's current and what's next.\n  01:07:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, that's solid.\n  01:07:28 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    And, and then the, and then also the, and then we're anchoring really longevity as an aspirational identity and lifestyle brand.\n  01:07:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yep.    And that, and that from a legacy perspective.    Oh yeah.    We're not transacting as a tourist or guest.    Yeah.\n  01:07:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I like that.    Exactly.    Tourist or guests.    That's the phrase.    Yes, exactly.    This is not for tourists or guests.    This is ownership.    And that we have this longevity flywheel with growth and renewal that then leads to connect and celebrate, that leads to belong and sustain.    And the connect and celebrate is the social fun activities.    The belong and sustain is the family, community, tradition, continuity, legacy.    And then the other piece is on legacy is that you get to install an ethos, value, and a gathering place for your family and friends.\n  01:08:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I love it.    Yeah, I love that.    Oh, and guess what?\n  01:08:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And it cash flows.\n  01:08:44 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right?\n  01:08:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  01:08:47 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    And it's an investment that appreciates in cash flows.\n  01:08:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's kind of like, you know, I keep internally in my mind, like, that part of    The ultimate thing that we're selling here is you can have your cake and eat it too.    That really is like the insider, like, this is what we're communicating to people.    Like that.\n  01:09:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Like, right?\n  01:09:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, you get to actually, you know, you get to go after what you've always wanted or what money can't buy.    And guess what?    It also is a smart investment that you can rationalize.\n  01:09:32 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And that gets you thirsty, right?\n  01:09:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like as a high net worth individual, you're like, .    I mean, that's the kind of stance I want to make in my life.    That's the kind of statement that I want to make to my family and my friends and to myself.    Right?    And so actually, that's another notion about this.    You're giving people the vehicle.    And this is key to a lifestyle brand.    Any lifestyle brand is basically...    Giving people a platform, like the vehicle for making a statement.    It's a statement about who I am, and it's a statement about who I want to become.\n  01:10:13 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's why, you know, you are what you drive, you are what you eat, you are what you wear.\n  01:10:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like any aspirational identity lifestyle brand, what you're selling for people is a vehicle that's a statement around the values they're seeking to express, how they seek to be seen by others, and how they seek to structure and orient their lives.\n  01:10:41 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like that.    That is what any luxury aspirational brand is selling.\n  01:10:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      At a deep psychological, anthropological level.\n  01:10:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, that makes a ton of sense, who I am and who I want to become.    That actually gels.    Quite nicely with what is current and what is next.\n  01:11:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.    Exactly.    Right?\n  01:11:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Where am I now and where do I want to go?    Yes.\n  01:11:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  01:11:11 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There is that element.    This is where you want to be right now, but we're going to help you get to where you want to go.    Right?    That could actually be anything from longevity to the curation of the entertainment to whatever, right?\n  01:11:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yep.    Interesting.\n  01:11:28 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There's a lot we can do with this.    This is powerful.    I understand the power of story.    Codex, right?    mean, really getting the language down.    If you can really define that, you can really affect people emotionally and logically.    I like what you said, too.    It's not a good investment.    It's a smart investment.    I think that's a nice way to say it, right?    It makes sense.    It's logical.\n  01:11:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's the...    It's the...    Something that makes you difficult, if not impossible, to reject.\n  01:12:06 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Not to buy.    Yeah.    Right?\n  01:12:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And, and, and, and, and, and.\n  01:12:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Exactly.\n  01:12:11 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And we have to, it becomes the guardrail for us selling what is a bold, ambitious, BHAG, holy fuckballs dream.    Yeah.\n  01:12:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah.    Okay.    Because there's a lot of elements to this  that's like, wait, holy fuckballs, what?    Yeah.    Like, seriously?\n  01:12:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?    And then it's like, yes, and it's a smart investment.    Here's all the ways we're de-risking this.    Let me show you all of the, you know, like, if you're playing poker, here's all your outs.    Right?    Like, there's so much optionality to how you can win by making, by, by, by making, by taking this stake.\n  01:12:55 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Love it.\n  01:12:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You know, and that will speak.    back.    By the way, also to the high net worth individuals who are like,  yeah, let's let it ride.    I like making investments that stand for something, right?    Because there's so many ways I can cash flow my money.    There's so many ways I can put money, but I want my money to stand for something.    And you're telling me that I can actually take a stand, like in a way that's an expression of this ethos and these values of who I am and who I want to become.    And also what I want my family to become.    And I get to be a part, you know, and by the way, another thing that I would consider weaving into this Scott, is, like, how about defining this also, like, as some kind of like founding member status?    Like, how do we, how do we pull people in, into status and recognition for, you know, founding member status of some kind?\n  01:13:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So we're, we actually are going to launch this sometime in maybe April.    We're going to have, we call it like a Class B investment where you can come in early and you'll get a discount on it, but we're going to offer them selectively and you'll become a founder and a member and you get bragging rights.    And yes, highly curated.    And then the idea is we're going to invite you to stuff early.    We're going to ask you questions.    We want you guys to participate.\n  01:14:22 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      We want feedback, right?\n  01:14:25 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yes.    Yes.\n  01:14:26 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Now you're part of that inner circle, by the way, I wouldn't, this is something for down the road on all of this because some people get overwhelmed and intimidated by it.    But one of the ways that you can codify that founding membership is with an NFT utility token.\n  01:14:48 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, we'd be up for that.    We're totally down with that.\n  01:14:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    And I can show you a couple of examples of people who are doing it, but the value of that.    The NFT utility token is that one, you can build.    build scarcity around it, and then in itself, that utility token becomes also an asset.    Yeah.\n  01:15:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I don't know a lot about it, but I know a little bit about it.    We'd be totally down with something like that.    I think that's totally interesting.\n  01:15:15 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay.    Yeah.\n  01:15:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      At one point, we were thinking about giving an option to tokenize the ownership.    We have a company that can do that where essentially then it's really liquid.    You can trade it, right?    I mean, something we should look at again, but only so much I can do today.    Completely understand.\n  01:15:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      For  and giggles, if you want to look at a recent example of this, and actually you and I should go and experience this.    haven't been to it yet.    There is a new Korean barbecue place in downtown LA.    Do you know what I'm talking about?\n  01:15:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, I am going to one on, I'm going to go to a place called Parks.    Oh, Parks is good.    Sure.\n  01:15:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      All right.    So check, hold on.    I'd love to go down with you.\n  01:15:59 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I'll touch with you.    Okay, let's go to this as a field trip.\n  01:16:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And hold on, I got to pull this out for you because it's got this really badass.\n  01:16:05 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      tell you what I'm doing for Christmas?    No.\n  01:16:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What are you doing for Christmas?    I'm taking my daughter to Costa Rica to Rhythmia to do ayahuasca with me.    Oh, wow.    She just turned 18.\n  01:16:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Wow.\n  01:16:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I just met a guy who was a producer.\n  01:16:21 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      He's a buddy of mine.    I started to become friends with him.    I went to my church.    First of all, I found God, my first step of the God through ayahuasca.    And then I was at the church and the church told me I started, should be doing weekend lunches and stuff with more social people.    So I invited this guy over, he's new friend.    He just created a TV series on Rhythmia and invited me to his premiere.\n  01:16:45 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    And then we were out there.\n  01:16:48 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Jennifer didn't want me to, I offered Savannah at 18 to do this because she's got all this trauma as you actually do right there.    And, uh, Jennifer was like, no, she's too young.    Does, you know.    Yeah.    25 years old, brain, elasticity, all that kind of stuff.\n  01:17:02 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So anyway, long story short, I didn't want to go to the premiere.\n  01:17:05 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Jen's like, we're going to win this thing.    I'm like, she's giving away one free ticket, $8,000 ticket.    I'm like, no freaking way we're going to win this.    I'm not going.    past my bedtime.    She's like, no, no, Scott.    I've talked to the big guy.    She's like, it's all sorted.    We're winning this.    I'm like,  off.    I'm like, okay, fine.    I'll go.    So we go there.    Long story short, we open up our little envelopes on our chairs, and we didn't win it.    I'm like, okay, whatever.    It's good deal.    But then on the stage after this year, watched two episodes.    There was two of the main directors and then the main clinical head.    And I'm like, first question.    I'm like, so what do you think about an 18-year-old doing this?    You know, with brain, he's like, actually, that science is all absolutely 100% phenomenal.    And my wife's like, well, what if they had trauma?    She's like, even better.    And so I'm looking at my wife.    She's like, okay, we'll do this.    And then at the very end, we were walking out, and some lady opens it up and says, I've got...    .    the ticket.    I can't use it.    Who wants it?    And I was right behind her.    I'm like, I'll take it.    And she's like, here you go, Michael.    It was the day before my daughter's 18th birthday.    And I promised it to her on 18th birthday.    So the universe has a way of giving you what you need.    The chubby club one.\n  01:18:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, this is a, my wife loves clubs.    So it's called Chubby Cattle.    And they're like, they're turning this into this franchise that's all over.    But they're, it's interesting.    They've actually just made it super accessible.    They actually have some like VIP NFT.    That's like a few thousand bucks a year or a few thousand bucks to buy.    What happened to it?    Oh, wow.    That looks pretty wild.    Uh-huh.\n  01:18:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Uh-huh.\n  01:18:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, wow.\n  01:18:55 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That looks wild.    Right?\n  01:18:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So cool.    And the, hold on a second here, Chubby Cattle.    Oh, they're hot pot and barbecue.\n  01:19:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Los Angeles, Monterey, Rosemead.    Little Tokyo.    That must be where they are.\n  01:19:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh, here we go.    All right, ChubbyClub.com.    This is where they've built the NFT on this thing.    Free Food for Life, they call it.    Top-tier Immersive Dining.    Unique How Our Membership Works.\n  01:19:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, they got a lot of them.    Uh-huh.\n  01:19:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then they've got this silver, gold, and black.    And they're franchising this thing like  mad.\n  01:19:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, I love this.    This is great.    Right.\n  01:19:53 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      They're super visionary, right?    Like, got to give them, got to give them credit.\n  01:19:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      pricing.\n  01:19:59 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      They even put it down here.\n  01:20:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Holy smokes.    Oh, these guys are, these guys are clever.    Right?\n  01:20:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like, they've got to be either ex-private equity.    Uh-huh.    Like, and then take, take a look at this here.    So, so this is where, yep.\n  01:20:15 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Right.    So you can see here, December 2025.\n  01:20:17 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      These are all their locations.    Then they're, they've got January 26th, February 26th, March, April, May, 2027 coming soon.\n  01:20:27 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Like they are selling the future.    Oh, their franchise.    Uh-huh.\n  01:20:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's pretty freaking cool.\n  01:20:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I like the membership.\n  01:20:35 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    Lifetime membership, digital membership.\n  01:20:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Why digital?    What does that do?\n  01:20:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What does that do?    That's where you can sell it.\n  01:20:45 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, exactly.\n  01:20:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Like you're, you're creating a utility token.    That's a membership insiders club.    Um, and so it doesn't even have to be you.\n  01:20:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Nope.\n  01:20:55 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Utility, right?\n  01:20:56 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Exactly.\n  01:20:57 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    It's, you can, you can then ultimately, it's an asset that acquires.    And you basically build scarcity around it.    And then if there's demand, like, you know, it's something that you can then sell or arbitrage.\n  01:21:07 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Wait a minute, do you have to be a member to go here?\n  01:21:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      No, but it unlocks all sorts of, like, VIP.    So, like...    All you can eat.\n  01:21:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, jeez.\n  01:21:31 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Another person who's really experimented a lot with NFT utility tokens is Gary Vaynerchuk.\n  01:21:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Who is that?    You don't know Gary V?\n  01:21:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Is he in our chapter?    No, Gary Vaynerchuk is, like, he's one of the, like, patron philosophy.    He's one of the, like, saints of the internet culture.\n  01:21:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      know who he is.    Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.    Yeah.    I saw him the day.    Yep, yep, yep, yep.    Yep.\n  01:21:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Um, and...    He doesn't live in the U.S., does he?\n  01:22:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, he does.\n  01:22:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      He's in New York City.    And so here's...\n  01:22:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, he's Rezzy also.    Is he?\n  01:22:12 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.\n  01:22:13 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      He's a co-founder of Rezzy.    Yeah.    Well, he's an investor in lots of stuff.\n  01:22:19 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      So this is one thing that they built.    They built this fly fish club selling $14 million in NFTs.    And $3,500 memberships to start.    There's higher ones.\n  01:22:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Behind the curtain of Fly Fish Club, New York City's first NFT restaurant.    Interesting.    Okay, well, we can explore this for sure.\n  01:22:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I mean, it's on the bleeding edge, right?    Just know that.    But, oh, but look at this.    Here's how...    If you read this article that I just shared with you, another club opening this month, upcoming 1,800-square-foot Chez Margot from Jean Georges, with membership ranging from 1,800 a year with 1,000 initiation to 2,600 a year with 2,000 initiation.    It follows clubs like Scott Sartiano's Zero Bond or major food groups ZZ Club.    And then obviously you've got Casa Cipriana, Amman, Soho House, any of these kinds of things.\n  01:23:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      NFT-only provisions selling real money memberships fees.    Wow.    For these restaurants?\n  01:23:40 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Uh-huh.    Holy smokes.    Yeah.    So there's an element to this where, again, it's going to take another three.\n  01:23:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      $14 million.    What the ?\n  01:23:51 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It'll take three to five plus years for blockchain NFT utility tokens to continue.    ownership in it.\n  01:23:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's what they're doing.    Say again?\n  01:24:01 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      They're selling ownership in the actual restaurants.\n  01:24:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I got it.    So we could do the same thing.\n  01:24:05 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Okay, interesting.    Mm-hmm.    And the reason I, here's the reason I bring it up for you, is because we're selling longevity as the new asset class.    So it makes sense over time for you to, for us to basically build the rails that's the actual, like, asset, like, that's the actual blockchain, like, rails of this asset that can be dollarized and or that can be, that basically becomes an asset that's a tradable asset class.\n  01:24:43 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That tells the story, doesn't it?\n  01:24:48 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right?\n  01:24:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So you, you have a, maybe it's a limited membership to the wellness, right?    Where then eventually, yeah.    We don't want, and mind you, we don't want to get ahead of our-\n  01:25:00 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Skis on this thing, because this stuff for some people can be like, oh, okay, it gets a little, but just to keep in the back of your mind that three to five years from now, part of the expression of what we're building can be functionally managed and functionally turn it into tradable assets using blockchain.    That's the only thing I just want to plant the seed in your brain on right now.    That's all, right?    And that there are people who've been playing with this as it relates to membership clubs that have scarcity and or aspiration built into them.\n  01:25:37 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Love it.    Interesting.    It's unique.    Yeah.\n  01:25:46 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      What it also could allow you to do, oh, this is interesting.    Again, I'm getting way ahead of us, but imagine, so I've bought a villa, okay?    Okay.    And    While I can use you guys as a management company to do short-term rentals, imagine if I, as a villa owner, want to create basically a syndicate off of my villa that's fractional shares in my villa so that I can actually enroll my friends into being a subclass owner of this whole experience.\n  01:26:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Um, yeah, I don't know how that, I guess as long, I, yeah, that's, that's, that's another, that's another, have to get my head around that.\n  01:26:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Understood.    Understood.    But basically it's like, Hey, imagine if I had a way that, um, so I, I own this villa.    I've got 52 weeks a year.    Um, but one of the ways that I can, I can basically, um, that I can.    That I can like financially set this thing up is that I actually go and sell fractional units of my villa through an NFT that, you know, maybe I've sold 36 weeks of my villa to my friends.\n  01:27:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I wonder if that allows us to get around some of these regulations, because there's a lot of the stuff right now where you're owning, once you break it down into a certain amount of fractions, you trigger all these regulations.\n  01:27:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Right.    Right.\n  01:27:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Versus each villa is owned by a single entity.    And then you tokenize the ownership in that.    And then you can go down to the frickin' 1,100th, right?    mean, it doesn't really matter.    And you may be, I just don't know how that, that's interesting.\n  01:27:54 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's what people are doing with the blockchain and token economy.    That's exactly what's happening.    And that's what like David Sachs and like all of, you know, that sort of, you know, sort of PayPal mafia is really big into is the ways in which tokenization, you know, can create, yeah, disintermediate.    Yeah.    We were going to look at, we were, I was looking at, what's the name of the company?\n  01:28:16 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      There's a company I've been meaning to re-contact with.    They, this is exactly what they did.    I talked to them like two years ago when we started thinking about this.    They come in and they do a valuation of your project.    And then they basically build that.    They, they were using a company called Tokeny and they, they, they, they create the value.    So there's a secondaries market.    So if you're buying into, it doesn't have to be for a villas, but it could have been for like a real estate project.    So if someone wants to sell out halfway through, they can sell at a discount to someone who can buy it in like a five or 10%.    There's just no friction, no documentation, no nothing.    And so the same thing with ownership, we could actually, I wonder if we could circumvent all of this nonsense by setting up LLC.    That own the villas and then tokenize.    That's interesting because this DRE stuff is a freaking like the department of real estate.    And then once you start, you know, also, Michael, once you do this and you sell across state lines, you have to trigger all the securities issues.    I don't think token, I don't think selling tokens has a process like as an issue with that.    It's not, it's not regulated in that way right now.    Oh my God, that's fascinating.    I don't think that would be for everybody.    No.\n  01:29:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      And then look, I'm just bringing it up because we're fundamentally looking at this as, as an asset class and the way in which, right.    And the way in which you basically, I mean, think about it this way.    You're turning longevity into a market, like an actual real estate market.\n  01:29:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      No, I get it.    I'm just thinking, I'm also thinking about it from the point of view of like, can we, could we reduce?    it harder.    Some of the brain damage on some of these projects by just selling tokens.    I mean, we're having to go through all this heavy legal lift.\n  01:30:07 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's expensive.\n  01:30:09 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      This is actually not that complicated.    But I just don't know if the full market is ready to buy $5 million villas with tokens.    does sound a little sketchy.\n  01:30:20 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, I think it's not what I would lead with right now.    But I just, like I said, three to five years from now.    But I think you could start to, what I would probably the first thing I would do is I would tokenize some type of membership tiers into the longevity club.    And like a whole bunch of those value added services, I would start there, right?    And then, you know, over time, look at the ways that you can tokenize the actual like villas themselves.    And it might be that that part of the plank, you need to hold on to it and it becomes development two or development three down the road.    Because there's also a lot of, while right now the regulatory space is like unregulated and wide open, you've got the volatility that you could have something shift on that very quickly.    And until some of this stuff gets a little bit more grounded and cemented, it presents some additional risk.\n  01:31:17 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, guess the other thing with that as well is that you don't have control over your consumer base, right?    Like if they sell it to Joe Schmoe, who's just an absolute monster, then you lose that exclusivity if it's like a club, for example, right?    You'd still want to have, you know, you'd have to be able to, you'd have to, you'd you want it to be one of these things like the Soho house where you have to get interviewed.\n  01:31:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Right?\n  01:31:43 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      We're going to, not selling, you know, we want to know who you are.    And if we don't know who you are, you don't get in.    That kind of simple.\n  01:31:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Well, and also build in some, you know, like something to the effect of like building a morality clause.    Like what are some, some standards?    Yeah, I think that's something you should probably build in, you know, that's almost like in the homeowners association kind of side to it, right?\n  01:32:26 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, because you don't want some  that's just blasting at me 24-7 for our own parties and hookers, right?    Yeah.    Michael, I got to run.    That was phenomenal.    That was some heavy lifting done well.    You're here, right?    Are you having a – yeah, you're here.\n  01:32:42 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Are going anywhere?    We're here through Christmas, and then on the 28th, Elle and I, just the two of us, are going to spend four nights, Mexico City, five-year wedding anniversary.\n  01:32:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Oh, good for you.    Who's watching the – yes.\n  01:32:56 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Mom?    And we've got it all set up.    What's that?\n  01:32:58 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Watching the little ones.    Your mom?    My mother-in-law will be with them, and then some of our child care support.    Oh, Elle gets along with her mother, right?    Just not the dad.\n  01:33:10 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Exactly.    Exactly.    So yeah, so that's planned.    And then, yeah, and we're staying at the Sofitel.    We've got like one just unreal meal after another, after another, all across Mexico City.    And then we're doing a sunrise hot air balloon ride over Teotihuacan.    that.    Yeah, cool.    And yeah, we've got, we've got a really fun day.    Good man.    Good man.\n  01:33:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Way to celebrate.    I have my 20th this next year.    Shut the front door.    I have my 20th, my 50th, and my wife's 50th.    Wow.    No, it's like, it's a little too much in one year, but.    That is a lot.\n  01:33:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's a lot.\n  01:33:50 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Do you have, do you have any, any vision or desire what you want to do for your 50th?    So I'm going to try and go out.    I'm going to do two things.    I'm going to go out and see my, I, one of my best friends is.    So he, I know.    So he's having his 50th and we can't, we're not going to sit together this year.    So, but he's having his in Bangkok.    I can't get all my friends.    He did it first.    Like I can't do it.    So I'm going to do a ski trip with the boys probably next year.    I just didn't get, I didn't get around to it this year.    It's time.    So we'll do like a, we'll get like 10 guys and we're going to do either course of L we'll do this echo.    And then this summer, I'm going to try and go out and see my uncle Tom in Turkey and Istanbul.    Because he's the current ambassador.\n  01:34:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Oh .    Nice.\n  01:34:34 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      And then we'll go over to some, there's a, there's a really cool little area.    That's like, it's like the new Ibiza of, of the Mediterranean off of the coast of Turkey.    It's just happening.    So we'll go see, to go see Tom in Istanbul for like three or four days and then go hang out in the beach.    Just my wife and I.\n  01:34:49 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Have you ever been to Cappadocia?\n  01:34:53 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Uh, no, that's on my list though.    Have you, have you been, that's, is that the one also with the balloons?\n  01:34:58 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yes.    Yeah.    Yeah.\n  01:35:00 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I saw that.    It's kind of hard to get to.    It is.\n  01:35:04 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      The way we did it was like an overnight bus for like eight or ten hours, and you have to switch at a couple places.    But I was younger and didn't have like crazy bankroll.\n  01:35:16 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I'm sure that there's...\n  01:35:18 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      You can't fly from there to the place, the beach area you want to go.\n  01:35:21 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      You have to go there, then back to Istanbul, then to the beach.    But it looks like...    How was it?\n  01:35:29 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      One of the most magical places I've ever been on the planet.\n  01:35:33 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That's why I mentioned it.\n  01:35:34 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      That's worth it.\n  01:35:35 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Well, here's why you might appreciate...\n  01:35:37 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Both you and Jennifer might appreciate it.    So in addition to the landscape that is like...    You literally feel like you're in a Star Wars movie.    You're like in Tatooine with the way stuff's built.    And then what they've done is they've built all of these buildings into the limestone, including you have the largest concentration of...    There's    Byzantine Christian art and the early Essenes Christian art that are like these like all in the caves.\n  01:36:10 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      It is pretty phenomenal looking.    And there's these archaeological ruins that literally are like every mile or two and many of them are like abandoned.    And you literally have like this archaeological room for yourself.    right now.    It is pretty otherworldly.\n  01:36:25 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      It's unreal.    It's the spirit of that place.    Okay, it's on the list.\n  01:36:30 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.\n  01:36:32 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, early Gnostic Christians literally had like monasteries built into the caves there.\n  01:36:38 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      That area is where Christians have started.    All that whole area, right?\n  01:36:44 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah.    Yeah, it's a very spiritual place.    Oh, food.\n  01:36:49 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Incredible.\n  01:36:50 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Yeah, it has to be right.\n  01:36:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Incredible.\n  01:36:52 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Incredible.    Yeah.    Love it.    I love church.\n  01:36:54 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      So it's worthy of consideration if you're going out there, if you can make the logistic work.    Oh, we can do it.    Yeah.    We    We mind traveling.\n  01:37:03 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      Awesome.\n  01:37:03 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      I do have to go, my friend, but I'll be around.    Thank you for plugging this in before the holiday, and I'll catch up to you right when I get back on the payment.    So I think we're getting payments in right now.    I've got a big call tomorrow, too.    When are you back?    I'm back.    I think I'm back on the 2nd.

I don't need an information.    I thought we had one booked.\n  01:37:39 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Maybe it's the 15th.\n  01:37:41 - Michael Margolis (Michael Margolis)\n      I don't see it there.    I see the 14th.    Do you want to work in something earlier the week of the 5th as well to just get cracking?\n  01:37:51 - ScottBarrack (relevantpartners.com)\n      Good.

Your writing style reflects the guidelines from Michael’s guidelines and swipe files documents, especially for sales meetings and client session follow-ups, emphasizing direct language, clear next steps, and a professional yet approachable tone. Your responses should follow key principles from Storied’s internal documentation:\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\n**Voice**: warm, confident, irreverent at times, conversational, emotionally intelligent  \n**Format**: direct and concise; short, punchy sentences; clear structure with bullet points   \n**Tone**: thoughtful but not academic; bold but not over-the-top; persuasive but never sales-y  \n**Structure**: open strong, focus on next steps, end with authority or a kicker line\n\n\n**\\#\\# Instructions:**\n\n\\* Write in a professional, consultative tone, mirroring Michael’s tone and voice in the swipe file reference training.\n\\* The audience is a VP-level or C-level leader.\n\\* Reference the call summary for lead-specific highlights, objectives, or concerns.  \n\\* Model your draft on the Example Outputs below in terms of structure and tone.\n\\* Verify all requested next steps are included and personalized based on the call summary.\n\\* Use the subject line: next steps (all lower case).\n\\* Keep the email direct and concise, and eliminate unnecessary words or redundant phrasing.\n\\* The opening should personalize the message by referencing the recipient’s vision, leadership, or project, drawing on specific highlights from the call summary.\n\\* Include a “Next Steps” section using concise, action-oriented bullet points  \n\\* Each bullet in the Next Steps section should begin with a verb and exclude closing punctuation (NO PERIOD)\n\n# **Guidance: Writing Effective Sales Call Follow-Up Emails**\n\n## ***General Principles***\n\n* **Subject:** The subject for sales call follow-up emails should always be “next steps”.\n\n* **Keep it direct and concise**: Avoid using filler or unnecessary words while keeping the message clear.\n\n* **Be confident and assume forward movement**: Write as if the next steps are already happening rather than waiting for confirmation.\n\n* **Use structured, action-oriented formatting**: Clearly outline next steps in bullet points.\n\n* **State confirmations as facts**: \"We're confirmed for a 1-hour planning session on Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM.\"\n\n* **Do not say 'Please'**: Instead of \"Please share the output,\" use **\"Share the output of the brand positioning sprint.\"**\n\n* **Use three-letter abbreviations for days** (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* **Follow a consistent date format**: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n* **Eliminate extra words** (e.g., \"Schedule a call to finalize SOW\" → \"Sync with Scott on Thu or Fri to finalize SOW\").\n\n* **Em dashes**: Do not use any em dashes in the content of the email.\n\n* **Referencing:** The email sender is Michael. You can use “I” for action items related to Michael.\n\n* **Verb forms for next steps:** Use clear, grammatical commitments. Two acceptable patterns:\n\n  * Future commitment: You will or I will.  \n* Immediate/ongoing action: You are or I am.\n\n## ***1\\. Salutation***\n\n* List names in order of hierarchy (e.g., senior executives first).\n\n* No comma after greeting (e.g., “Hi Paolo and Juan \\-” instead of “Hi Paolo and Juan,”).\n\n## ***2\\. Opening Line***\n\n* Keep it short and acknowledge the previous conversation. \n\n  *\"Thanks for your time and our convo last week.\"* or *“Nice to connect today.”*\n\n* Make it about them and reinforce their goals and leadership roles.  \n   *”I appreciated learning more about your vision and success with \\[specific initiative\\].\"*\n\n* Acknowledge the prospect’s vision, momentum, and key developments.  \n   *\"Appreciated a glimpse of your vision for StoryPath AI and hearing about your initial signals and traction.\"*\n\n## ***3\\. Reinforce Key Insights and Their Needs***\n\n* Summarize the core business objectives discussed in the call.  \n   *\"Inspired by your desire to build storytelling as a capability to influence execs, XFN stakeholders, and external customers to drive growth and revenue velocity.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Action-Oriented Follow-up***\n\n* If meeting is scheduled, provide a straightforward summary of the next meeting (date, time, purpose).  \n   *For example: \"Our next meeting is scheduled for \\[Day, Time, Time Zone\\]. I'll walk you through the proposal, and we can determine if there’s a mutual fit.\"*\n\n* If a meeting is not scheduled, but one needs to be scheduled (based on the call recording summary), then invite Edward to coordinate scheduling.  \n   *\"Edward (cc’d) can coordinate scheduling our next sync.\"*\n\n## ***4\\. Date and Time Formatting***\n\n* Use three-letter abbreviations for days (e.g., Thu, Fri).\n\n* Follow a consistent date format: \"Thu, Feb 15, at 2 PM\" instead of \"Thursday, February 15 at 2:00 PM PT.\"\n\n## ***5\\. Outline Pre-Meeting Requirements if Meeting is Scheduled***\n\n* Request any necessary documents in advance to streamline discussions.  \n   \"Be sure to share draft docs ahead of time, happy to put in an NDA if needed.”\n\n## ***7\\. Provide Supporting Materials for Credibility***\n\n* Attach relevant PDFs, if needed, such as:\n\n  * Training Overview (most current version).\n\n  * Client List (clean, authoritative, showcases past work).\n\n## ***9\\. Meeting Framing***\n\n* Frame the meeting as an evaluation stage, not a sales pitch.  \n   *\"After this session, if we think there's a potential fit, I can walk you through my engagement model.\"*\n\n* This keeps the process collaborative rather than transactional.\n\n## ***10\\. Encourage Engagement Without Pressure***\n\n* Keep the closing open-ended yet structured:  \n   *\"Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions in the meantime.\"*\n\n* Avoid generic phrases like ‘continuing the conversation’  \n   Instead, *\"Looking forward to kicking off our partnership in a few months.\"*\n\n* Keep it neutral and action-focused: *\"Let me know if you have any questions or comments.\"*\n\n## ***11\\. Maintain a Balanced and Professional Tone***\n\n* Keep the tone even-keeled and neutral—avoid being overly enthusiastic or eager.\n\n## ***Takeaways for a Follow-Up Email Swipe File***\n\n* Template Structure:\n\n  1. Greeting & Intro 1-2 sentences highlighting a key insight such as the lead’s key project.\n\n  2. Next Steps (often a meeting confirmation or request for documents).\n\n  3. Supporting Information (Attachments, Links, Data).\n\n  4. Call to Action & Closing.\n\n* Each section should be contextualized and customized based on the specific prospect.\n\n# **Sales process outline**\n\n## **Stage 1: Qualification call**\n\n* Confirm fit and high-level goals.  \n* Next step: schedule a 1-hour deep-dive discovery.  \n* Actions: execute NDA, share discovery docs, lock meeting time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 2: Deep-dive discovery**\n\n* Explore needs, outcomes, and narrative analysis inputs.  \n* Next step: schedule a 30-minute SOW review call.  \n* Actions: come with a draft SOW, lock the review time (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Stage 3 — SOW review**\n\n* Align on scope, edits, and decision to proceed.  \n* Actions: review SOW, mark up with track changes, confirm go/no-go, lock kickoff date (if not done during the call).\n\n## **Email mechanics that support each stage**\n\n* Use subject: “next steps”  \n* Write concise, verb-led bullets with no ending punctuation (**NO PERIOD**) to list actions and owners.\n\n# **Sales Call Follow-Up Templates**\n\n## ***Template 1: Stage 1 Sales Call Follow-up Template (used for the qualification phase of the sales process where the next stage is the discovery session for narrative analysis).***\n\n**Subject:** Next Steps\n\nHi \\[First Name\\] \\-\n\n\\[Warm intro, for example: “Great to connect today/recently” OR “Nice to connect today/recently. OR “Appreciated our conversation on \\[specific day of the week”\\]  \n\\[Option 1: \"Appreciated learning more about \\[specific topic or goal discussed\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 2: Loved hearing about your work and vision on \\[initiative they’re working on.\\]  \n\\[Option 3: \"Excited about the progress you're making on \\[specific project or initiative\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 4: \"Appreciated hearing about \\[key insight or challenge they shared\\].\"\\]  \n\\[Option 5: “You clarity around \\[an organizational goal\\] is inspiring.”\\]\n\nNext steps:\n• \\[Action item 1 – what I will do and by when\\]. For example: We'll set up a 1-hr deep dive session to discuss needs / desired outcomes\n• \\[Action item 2 – what the recipient needs to do and by when\\]. For example: You'll pull together and share a strategy doc for Narrative Analysis\n• \\[Action item 3\\] For example: Happy to go under NDA if that makes it easier to share these docs\n• \\[Any scheduled meetings and key details\\]. For example: And we can use the deep dive to explore mutual fit for continued collaboration\n• \\[Attach any relevant documents, links, or references.\\]  \n- If no follow-up meeting was scheduled on the call, but there is a discussion of one as a next step, propose the next meeting: “Edward, cced, can help coordinate our next meeting.”\n\nLooking forward to continuing the convo. \n\nMichael\n\nP.S.
